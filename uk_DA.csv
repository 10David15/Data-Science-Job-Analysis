“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

The attention to detail to become a quick and accurate coder.

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

The attention to detail to become a quick and accurate coder.

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs
Requirements

About You
Aptitude and passion for statistics/mathematics: the majority of our analysts have good degrees in STEM subjects or Economics, however we are looking for aptitude rather than education.
Enthusiasm to develop coding skills, ideally with some knowledge of SQL, with Python as a bonus.
An inquiring mind that seeks for the insight in the data.
The attention to detail to become a quick and accurate coder.
You can synthesise information into clear and logical presentations
ClearScore is a rapidly evolving company, you need to be comfortable with the ambiguity that creates –if being asked to switch teams or projects will unsettle you then this is probably not a place you will thrive.
You want to learn as much as possible.
A desire to integrate with and protect our culture.

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

The attention to detail to become a quick and accurate coder.

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.

ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.

We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.

The Team

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.

ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.

At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.

The Role

As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.

You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.

This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.

Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.

Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs

The attention to detail to become a quick and accurate coder.
