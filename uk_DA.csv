Develop and deliver training on SQL, Python, data visualisation practices, and more
The role

We're looking for someone who is skilled at and motivated by helping to make and enable sound organisational decisions using quantitative data.

'Making' in the sense that you'll often be tasked to conduct rigorous analysis, using a variety of tools, to deliver meaningful insights. 'Enabling' in the manner that you're excited to help mentor and coach others in their own analytics efforts, and possess the skills to help bring greater consistency and robustness to our data sources and analytical workflows.

This role is technical in that it requires use of a diverse array of techniques and technologies to extract and prepare high-quality analysis. At the same time, there is a great deal of flexibility in your ability to focus on a subset of our team's broad mission and grow your skill set accordingly, whether that's in rigorous project management, deep statistical analysis, or robust pipeline engineering.

As a group we want to enhance the way DeepMind as a whole makes decisions and takes action, so there are many different ways team members can further this aim.

A core set of the responsibilities this role encompasses:

Work with partners to identify relevant high-level business questions and propose relevant data-focused analysis

Coach and mentor others in their own use of analytical tools and technique
About you

What we are looking for in the ideal candidate:

You excel at analytical problem solving with a 'nose for data', knowing which questions to ask of it, how to go about answering those questions, and how to ensure that your answer is correct.

You enjoy using a variety of technical tools to answer the question at hand. You recognise that there are lots of potential ways to approach a problem, and enjoy choosing the right tool for the job. You enjoy learning new technologies and techniques when appropriate.

You consider yourself 'business savvy'. You have proven experience working with various internal partners, and an intuition for which questions are most important to hone in on in service of our mission.

You are passionate about 'storytelling' with data.

You know how to optimally express uncertainty in your conclusions, and key assumptions that have gone into the analytical process.

Qualities that are an asset

You are comfortable extracting and manipulating data via SQL (especially BigQuery and Google's StandardSQL implementation) and Python and the PyData stack (e.g. Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy, NumPy, Jupyter)
You might be familiar with some other aspects of ETL management (e.g. Apache Beam, Apache Spark, Airflow, Luigi), data modelling (e.g. DBT, Snowflake), and data visualisation (e.g. Tableau, Data Studio, d3.js, Matplotlib, Vega, Altair, etc.), or are at least excited to learn more
You like to 'work quantitatively', and have at least a basic solid understanding of statistical concepts that let you express ambiguity in your analysis and assumptions
You've previously taught yourself new tools/techniques to expand your skillset
You have experience partnering with senior decision-makers in a professional setting
You consistently strive to see 'beyond the data' and understand what your analysis represents in terms of actual reality/experience
You enjoy collaborating widely, and partnering with others to empower action and change

If you don't think you embody all of the above criteria, please still seriously consider applying! This role (and therefore the requirements) is broad, and we'd be excited to discuss how you see yourself contributing across it!

We hire a diverse range of junior professionals and graduates from across the country, we pay you while we train you in the latest data and business skills and then place you into industry-leading companies in a variety of different sectors. Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.

Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau

What we need from you:
A desire to work with multiple stakeholders and facilitating effective communication between them
A love for problem solving, making sense of something complex and communicating it to others in a way that is easy to understand
An ambition to work with data - don’t let it intimidate you, learning some coding is crucial in today’s age

About Project Imagine

Project Imagine is a new kind of finance company. We're on a mission to make the financial industry fairer, financial growth mutual and financial education accessible. How? With an unconventionally diverse team, a passion for change and a groundbreaking business model.

The traditional model used by old banks and new fintechs alike makes financial growth for customers near impossible, because it profits from their short term, unsecured debt. Essentially the companies you trust to look after your money are not in the business of looking after your money.

But it doesn't need to be that way. Success can be mutual, and that's how we've designed our customer product, Dozens. Dozens is a comprehensive financial wellness app that combines a current account, budgeting, saving tools, investments and financial education all in one place to help people effectively manage their money and achieve their financial goals. We can proudly say that we do everything possible to help our customers move forward financially, because it helps us move forward, too.

While Dozens is helping customers, our B2B product, PI1, is helping the rest of the industry. PI1 is a cloud-based, fully modular, bank-in-a-box platform for end-to-end digital banking services. It integrates multiple, best-in-class fintech solutions into a single API, and comes with an advanced analytics platform. PI1 supports the Dozens mission by bringing PI to profitability sooner, reducing the requirement for external investment in the future, and so completing the loop of our self-sustaining ecosystem.

We started from one belief: that businesses deserved better. That people pouring their hearts into their passion should be paid reliably, efficiently and affordably. After all, passion, not money makes the world go round. So we decided to shake up the payments industry for good.

We pride ourselves on using smart technology and an unswerving dedication to service, leaving customers free to grow their companies. After all, doing so is hard work - taking payments shouldn’t be.

To continue innovating and leading the payments industry, we need exceptional individuals. Our success is due to our talented teams going above and beyond to make payments painless, security simple and compliance easy for our customers.

Our analytics platform and MI solution are used by senior figures throughout Kantar to drive informed operational decision-making and the integration of additional business data sources is a critical step toward providing stakeholders with a holistic, unified view of the company. This role will focus on data from ERP (Maconomy, Navision, Dynamics AX) and other business systems (Workday/HR, Salesforce, CRM), ensuring that data is extracted securely from source platforms and moved into Kantar’s central Azure data lake, where it will be transformed into data models using the Azure technology stack (ADF, Synapse DWH, AAS). The data are presented to business users through PowerBI dashboards and advanced analytical applications.

Ideally, the role will be based in Kantar’s UK or German offices (nationwide), however, we may also be open to exploring remote working/other European locations, depending on the time zone.

Key Outcomes

Integration of additional data feeds into Kantar’s central business analytics platform and management information solution.

Design and implementation of secure extraction and transfer processes, to provide the data warehouse with secure, high-quality, and timely data feeds.

Maintenance and improvement of existing data feeds and associated extraction/transfer processes; resolution of all errors and exceptions.

Liaising with data owners, as well as Security and Data Governance teams, to ensure data is handled according to appropriate privacy and security protocols (covering anonymisation, aggregation, and/or encryption where required).

Understanding and anticipating changes to source data and systems (what is recorded, where, how); mitigating the impact of these changes on the analytics platform and MI solution.

Capabilities

Extensive technical knowledge of data warehouses and ETL processes/systems, with deep experience in source data extraction and transfer to cloud-based systems (covering scheduled CSV exports, REST APIs, template-based files).

Knowledge of relational databases and the required tools to manage data extraction (SQL, T/PL-SQL, SSIS), as well as strong Excel proficiency.

Practical experience working with reporting and dashboarding solutions; Azure and PowerBI strongly preferred, but knowledge of Tableau, Qlik, or similar systems is also useful.

Strong, broad understanding of business systems - across finance, HR, CRM, operations - and the applications of business data.

Lateral thinking and creative problem-solving skills, with a track record of improving ways of working and designing new solutions.

Strong organisational skills, with an ability to keep on top of project scope, progress, and deadlines, whilst diligently recording solutions and process documentation.

Responsibilities
• Leading and conducting research and development projects with the aim of delivering changes and improvements to economic statistics. These improvements could be to existing data sources, compilation methods and processes, or could be related to the development of new outputs or more general analysis, such as required for sector classification.
• Assessing and analysing data and/or information to produce clear and high quality qualitative and quantitative evidence which can be used to inform decision-making both within ONS and by external stakeholders.
• Collaborating with a range of stakeholders (internal and external) to research, develop and (where appropriate) implement improvements, providing technical and analytical expertise.
• Providing subject matter expertise within their area of work. For instance, by leading or contributing to how statistics guidance in the international manuals, guidance notes and similar should be interpreted.
• Ensuring their own, and their teams, technical and analytical skills are kept up-to-date.
• Deputising for Team Leader when appropriate.
• Participating in and promoting a culture of continuous improvement.

Person Specification

Essential Criteria:
• Demonstrable experience of applying, and supporting others in applying, analytical tools, skills and knowledge; including the selection and application of innovative methods to a range of different situations and producing high quality quantitative and qualitative analysis.

• Strong communication skills, to technical and non-technical audiences through all mediums, including the ability to be impartial and delineate between evidence and assumptions.

Location: Currently home based due to Covid 19 Lockdown measures

About us

Our vision is safe, effective and kind nursing and midwifery that improves everyone’s health and wellbeing. As the professional regulator of more than 710,000 nursing and midwifery professionals, we have an important role to play in making this a reality.

Our core role is to regulate. First, we promote high professional standards for nurses and midwives across the UK, and nursing associates in England. Second, we maintain the register of professionals eligible to practise. Third, we investigate when nursing or midwifery care goes wrong – something that affects less than one percent of professionals each year.

To regulate well, we support our professions and the public. We create resources and guidance that are useful throughout people’s careers, helping them to deliver our standards in practice and address new challenges. We also support people involved in our investigations, and we’re increasing our visibility so people feel engaged and empowered to shape our work.

Regulating and supporting our professions allows us to influence health and social care. We share intelligence from our regulatory activities and work with our partners to support workforce planning and sector-wide decision making. We use our voice to speak up for a healthy and inclusive working environment for our professions.

About the role

As a Data Governance Analyst, you will administer and analyse the processes and procedures associated with data capture, processing, and output to identify where data quality and data governance issues within the organisation exist, and work with the Data Owners and Stewards to mitigate risks and to ensure that data held across the NMC is accurate and of high quality. The post holder will also contribute to the effectiveness of the Data Governance Board in providing an efficient and high quality service for ensuring accurate source data across the NMC and will provide high-quality advice, guidance, problem solving and liaison across the NMC to establish the Data Governance framework and planning delivering for all activities within the project.

About you

The person we’re looking for has a willingness to challenge underlying assumptions and the status quo. You’ll have highly developed communication and influencing skills and be resilient and self-confident to drive through change. You’ll be confident working independently, problem solving, and speaking truth to power where needed.

You’ll have experience of working with similar issues – particularly around Data Quality or business analysis – knowledge or experience of preparing and presenting a wide range of complex information to a variety of stakeholders at all levels.

You’ll have a balance of skills – both technical (for example some basic SQL knowledge, and the ability to use BI tools like MS PowerBI), and interpersonal – for example presenting data and data topics to a non-technical audience, and influencing their decision making.

Most of all you’ll be a creative, analytical thinker – able to find their way around a perceived problem to the solution or root cause, and able to bring our stakeholders along with you as you do.

Why work for the NMC?

Our people are at the heart of everything we do. We aim to recruit the right people in the right places and we value the contribution they make to the success of our organisation. In return, we offer a comprehensive and competitive benefits package. To find out further information, please look at our benefits page.
