Deliver insights and improve decision-making

Contribute to our analytics infrastructure

Success across these areas will have a material impact on the company's operations and management, offering exciting opportunities to dive deeply into a wide array of technical analysis, collaborate closely with talented partners throughout the organisation, and apply/grow your skill set.

Develop and deliver training on SQL, Python, data visualisation practices, and more
The role

We're looking for someone who is skilled at and motivated by helping to make and enable sound organisational decisions using quantitative data.

'Making' in the sense that you'll often be tasked to conduct rigorous analysis, using a variety of tools, to deliver meaningful insights. 'Enabling' in the manner that you're excited to help mentor and coach others in their own analytics efforts, and possess the skills to help bring greater consistency and robustness to our data sources and analytical workflows.

This role is technical in that it requires use of a diverse array of techniques and technologies to extract and prepare high-quality analysis. At the same time, there is a great deal of flexibility in your ability to focus on a subset of our team's broad mission and grow your skill set accordingly, whether that's in rigorous project management, deep statistical analysis, or robust pipeline engineering.

As a group we want to enhance the way DeepMind as a whole makes decisions and takes action, so there are many different ways team members can further this aim.

A core set of the responsibilities this role encompasses:

Work with partners to identify relevant high-level business questions and propose relevant data-focused analysis

Communicate via presentations and written reports to a wide variety of stakeholders (with varying levels of seniority, technical and domain familiarity) – following through to ensure impact
Identify work appropriate for regular tracking, building appropriate reports and dashboards for consistency and ease of access
Manage several projects simultaneously, exhibiting good project management skills (timelines, expectations, progress, etc.)
Recommend changes to product/engineering roadmaps to improve data quality in source systems
Submit tested code into source control for review
Coach and mentor others in their own use of analytical tools and technique
About you

What we are looking for in the ideal candidate:

You excel at analytical problem solving with a 'nose for data', knowing which questions to ask of it, how to go about answering those questions, and how to ensure that your answer is correct.

You enjoy using a variety of technical tools to answer the question at hand. You recognise that there are lots of potential ways to approach a problem, and enjoy choosing the right tool for the job. You enjoy learning new technologies and techniques when appropriate.

You consider yourself 'business savvy'. You have proven experience working with various internal partners, and an intuition for which questions are most important to hone in on in service of our mission.

You are passionate about 'storytelling' with data. You're great at translating deeply technical analysis into insights and conclusions that everyone can grasp, independent of prior context or expertise. You know how to optimally express uncertainty in your conclusions, and key assumptions that have gone into the analytical process.

Qualities that are an asset

You are comfortable extracting and manipulating data via SQL (especially BigQuery and Google's StandardSQL implementation) and Python and the PyData stack (e.g. Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy, NumPy, Jupyter)
You might be familiar with some other aspects of ETL management (e.g. Apache Beam, Apache Spark, Airflow, Luigi), data modelling (e.g. DBT, Snowflake), and data visualisation (e.g. Tableau, Data Studio, d3.js, Matplotlib, Vega, Altair, etc.), or are at least excited to learn more
You like to 'work quantitatively', and have at least a basic solid understanding of statistical concepts that let you express ambiguity in your analysis and assumptions
You've previously taught yourself new tools/techniques to expand your skillset
You have experience partnering with senior decision-makers in a professional setting
You consistently strive to see 'beyond the data' and understand what your analysis represents in terms of actual reality/experience
You enjoy collaborating widely, and partnering with others to empower action and change

If you don't think you embody all of the above criteria, please still seriously consider applying! This role (and therefore the requirements) is broad, and we'd be excited to discuss how you see yourself contributing across it!

What we offer

You will join a diverse and vibrant environment where you can influence and have impact on groundbreaking research results. You will enjoy a creative and stimulating work environment and direct access to world-class researchers!

About Project Imagine

Project Imagine is a new kind of finance company. We're on a mission to make the financial industry fairer, financial growth mutual and financial education accessible. How? With an unconventionally diverse team, a passion for change and a groundbreaking business model.

The traditional model used by old banks and new fintechs alike makes financial growth for customers near impossible, because it profits from their short term, unsecured debt. Essentially the companies you trust to look after your money are not in the business of looking after your money.

But it doesn't need to be that way. Success can be mutual, and that's how we've designed our customer product, Dozens. Dozens is a comprehensive financial wellness app that combines a current account, budgeting, saving tools, investments and financial education all in one place to help people effectively manage their money and achieve their financial goals. We can proudly say that we do everything possible to help our customers move forward financially, because it helps us move forward, too.

While Dozens is helping customers, our B2B product, PI1, is helping the rest of the industry. PI1 is a cloud-based, fully modular, bank-in-a-box platform for end-to-end digital banking services. It integrates multiple, best-in-class fintech solutions into a single API, and comes with an advanced analytics platform. PI1 supports the Dozens mission by bringing PI to profitability sooner, reducing the requirement for external investment in the future, and so completing the loop of our self-sustaining ecosystem.

About the job
Summary
This vacancy sits within the Head Office and Navy Command (HO&NC) programme team within the Cost Assurance and Analysis Service (CAAS) team. CAAS has a proud heritage which dates back over 100 years to World War One when it was formed to prevent the munitions industry from overcharging the Government. The complexities of equipment procurement forced the government at the time to recruit its own technical cost engineers into the Civil Service, to advise commercial colleagues what non-competed contract prices should be paid to industry. This forms the heart of the purpose of CAAS.
Today, the CAAS team of over 300 estimators, cost engineers, project managers, portfolio analysts and accountants provide expert independent costing advice to enable the Ministry of Defence to make effective business decisions on equipment procurement and support. CAAS provides dedicated teams to independently support customers across the MOD, including Head Office, Front Line Commands, Defence Equipment & Support and Defence Infrastructure Organisation.
CAAS is geographically dispersed around the UK with offices close to or within sites of key Defence Industrial Suppliers
The applicant will support the CAAS team, under the direction of MOD Director General Finance, to position itself at the heart of Defence and provide leadership in Cost Management to Front Line Commands (FLC), Head Office and Enabling Organisations. This will be primarily to ensure that FLCs have a better understanding of value for money, risk, their cost base and affordability.
The main role of the successful applicant will be to analyse and present information (both financial and non-financial) that explains baseline statistics and other costings to support the CAAS HO&NC Programme objectives, adopting acknowledged good practice.
Responsiveness plays a key part in providing evidence-based information to support decision making across stakeholder priorities and supports pan-Defence working. This role therefore requires a highly collaborative approach in delivery of quality outputs.

Data Management Analyst,-1,"Job Introduction
We are looking for a diligent and efficient candidate for a fixed-term role in our IT&D Data Solutions team. This role will be key to the data and analytics work supporting Brighton & Hove City Council’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have been developing a number of data platforms and capabilities to consolidate disparate data into holistic records for people and properties across the Local Authority area. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly escalated the pace of that work, with Digital, Data and Analysis teams across the Council working collaboratively to support front-line services.

Whilst the initial response has slowed, more work is needed to consolidate our recent achievements, to ensure we can rapidly meet any rise in demand. With that in mind, we are introducing a role to gather data, introduce automation, and efficiently populate central data warehouses with relevant high-quality information.

The successful candidate will have demonstrable experience of building databases, primarily using Microsoft SQL Server. They must have knowledge of optimising database performance, enabling them to create resilient and scalable data stores.

If successful in your application, you will be responsible for populating those databases through efficient data flows—extracting and transforming data from multiple sources. Knowledge of data transformation tools like SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), FME, as well as scripting languages like Python and PowerShell is key. Experience in calling APIs (RESTful, SOAP, GraphQL) to access and extract data would be beneficial.

Additionally, you will be able to carry out analysis on the data, supplying support and capacity for other analysts in IT&D and around the Council. Brighton & Hove City Council has recently selected Power BI as its data visualisation tool of choice. You will have experience of using Power BI, or similar tools. Experience with more advanced analytical techniques and tools (Python, R) is highly desirable.

Overall, we are looking for candidates with the potential and curiosity to build on existing skills and learn new ones.

You will not only possess technical skills but will be able to enthusiastically engage customers across the Council. You will bring with you an enquiring and creative approach to your work to support services in deriving further insight from our corporate data.

Tasks and responsibilities

The role is based in the IT & Digital department of Brighton & Hove City Council. Working closely with colleagues in the Data Solutions team, the successful candidate will lead on our growing Power BI data visualisation platform.

Key responsibilities include:

Create automated processes for loading Health datasets into a central database
Ensure that Public Health dashboards are refreshed at an appropriate frequency
Deliver high-quality bespoke analysis
Use of ClearCore to match data from multiple sources
Support Data Analyst teams in adopting Power BI

As well as having technical and analysis skills and experience, you will possess time-management skills, enabling you to organise a sometimes-disparate workload, meet deadlines and keep customers satisfied.

The successful candidate will meet and collaborate with other teams, including DevOps, Information Governance, and Public Health Intelligence. This will provide opportunities to share knowledge and gain exposure to a wider range of skills.

Working at Brighton & Hove City Council

Working at the Council comes with numerous benefits, including flexible working options.

IT&D teams are a diverse and a truly international group. Just within the Digital & Data teams we have people from all over the world, including South Africa, Serbia, Taiwan and across the UK.

You'll find us a really open and welcoming group of colleagues who encourage a respectful, supportive and collaborative work ethic. We completely endorse a flexible workplace, with our staff working full time, part-time, and compressed hours, to fit around care commitments and work life balance needs. With everyone working remotely, we’ve found ways to keep connected and keep up some social contact with work colleagues through daily morning meetings and informal lunchtime virtual gatherings.

Our team develops its staff through internal and external training, and identifying and providing opportunities for development. For example, one of our digital team managers joined us as an apprentice from a non-IT background just over 5 years ago!

Whilst working in the public sector comes with challenges, it can also be extremely satisfying to see our efforts benefit others. We are proud of what we do.

Your starting salary will be pro rata if the above position is part-time or term-time only.

Work Permits: we may be able to obtain a Work Permit for this post but this is subject to meeting the requirements of the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) Points-based Immigration System.

Are you an experienced Data Analyst who wants to lead the Data area within a scaling-up digital entertainment app that’s at the forefront of the new ""online"" way of socialising?

Are you looking to work somewhere you're part of a team who take pride in working together?

Does working within a team who are straightforward, constantly challenging themselves and always learning with a genuine love for what they’re creating appeal?

We’re looking for someone who is energetic and proactive who is fascinated by digging into numbers to find cause and effect. You’ll have the doggedness to chase up people around the business to help put a user story around the analysis and will leave no stone unturned in your search for understanding the stats.
The Role*
We’re looking for an experienced Data professional to lead the data workstream on our fascinating and unique chat and entertainment app for iOS, Android and the web - WOLF, The World’s Online Festival.

You’ll take ownership of the data being used across the business to drive the strategy and impact the day-to-day decisions by multiple stakeholders. You’ll oversee and be directly involved with the interpretation and management of live data. You’ll use this to mitigate business risks and highlight insights to impact upon business decisions.

The business currently has multiple sets of data using multiple access points, along with software and processes that require real ownership. You’ll define and deliver an eloquent data-analysis and reporting process to drive the business forward. The role is about business engagement and influence. We have a technical solution that’s fit-for-purpose, but it’s important that you’ll get hands-on with data and are comfortable with our small-company, scaling-up environment.

The ideal candidate will have a background in mathematics/statistics, experience in a quantitative field, working with multiple data sets, and leading in data-driven decision making. You are focused on results, a self-starter, and have demonstrated success in using analytics to drive the understanding, growth, and success of a digital product.

Ideally you would be familiar with the world of mobile and web apps and also Google data tools. The former is highly desirable, the latter less essential.

The role is about proactively investigating the numbers and using apparent anomalies and unexpected insights to provoke change in our development priorities, support processes, marketing campaigns and community activity. You should now be able to use the output of our data infrastructure to constructively sense check everything we do. You'll challenge our thinking and assumptions about user behaviour and will identify the key points where we can intervene in the user experience / user journey to really make an impact.

Day to day you'll apply your expertise in analysis and presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with both our app and web properties.

You'll partner with product/engineering teams, marketing/community teams, and finance team to solve problems, identify trends/opportunities, and deliver key reports and insights in a timely fashion.

You'll inform, influence, support, and execute our strategic decisions and product launches, to help us become a more data-driven organisation than ever before.

You'll be the line manager for our Insights Manager, and the lead the Data workstream involving our wider data team.
About Us*
WOLF’s mission is to bring the magic of real-world festivals to the online world - uniting people across the globe in discovery, entertainment and belonging.

“Logistics for a sustainable world.” That is the mission at the heart of Stuart Delivery.

The best way to prepare is to reflect on what you feel your personal strengths are and your preferred way of working. It’s important to remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions. Don’t rehearse any answers because we are looking for your initial response. You will not be notified of the strengths being tested before your interview.

More information regarding video interviews, including the technical requirements are attached to this job advert.

The Video Blended Interviews will take place from week commencing 30th November 2020.

Feedback will only be provided if you attend an interview.

The Video Blended Interview places will be made available through Civil Service Jobs to successful applicants on a first come, first serve basis. You will be required to provide us with ID before your Blended Interview.

Security Clearance

Successful applicants will be required to have or obtain security clearance to Security Check (SC) level after taking up duty. We will ask you to confirm by email prior to attending your face to face blended interview as to whether you hold security clearance at SC level to enable us to update our records. This will enable us to identify as to who we will need to email the Security Clearance at SC level application form.

Security clearance at SC level is normally dependent on applicants physically living in the UK for the last 5 years. If you do not meet the UK residency requirements, for example, you have lived outside the UK for 6 months or more within the last 5 years you will have to provide more information, which may include obtaining Police Certificates from the countries you visited. This will cause delays to the security clearance process.

For those candidates who accept a provisional offer and have passed their pre-employment checks will be sent a Security Clearance at SC level application. The process for applying for SC level security clearance includes:

• Completion of a Security Clearance Questionnaire
• Checks against UK criminal and security records
• Credit reference check

In some cases it may also include an interview.

If you do not already hold SC level security clearance you will be conditionally appointed once you have passed your pre-employment checks, pending the award of SC level security clearance. Your duties may be restricted during the SC level security clearance process.

If you are unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary SC level security clearance you will be unable to remain within the Data Analyst role and you will be redeployed to another role within HM Revenue & Customs at the same grade and on the same terms and conditions.

Probation

Successful candidates new to the Civil Service will undergo a 12-month Civil Service probation running concurrently with the Specialist Trial Period. Any candidate failing their probation will have their employment with HM Revenue and Customs terminated.

Existing HMRC and Other Government Department (OGD) employees (who transfer to HMRC) with less than 12-months’ service will need to serve the balance of their probation with HMRC.

Existing HMRC and Other Government Department (OGD) employees who have already successfully completed their 12-month probation are not subject to a further period of probation.

Specialist Trial Period

Once appointed all candidates must complete a Specialist Trial Period (STP) of 12 months.

You will be conditionally appointed for the duration of the STP and probation.

The STP is a pass / fail work and classroom-based programme. It aims to assess key areas of learning and development necessary to perform at the required standard for a HEO Data Analyst. In order to complete the STP you must:

1) Successfully complete a programme of mandatory training packages.

2) Maintain a portfolio of evidence competence against the learning objectives detailed in the STP Workbook.

3) Successfully pass all technical assessments. You are allowed two attempts in total to pass these technical assessments. If you fail the technical assessments a second time, you will automatically fail your STP. You will not be allowed a second attempt to pass your STP.

You should be aware that the structure of the STP training programme includes several multi-day courses. As not all courses can be delivered in your home office location you may be required to travel and be away from home for up to 5 days at a time.

Existing HMRC employees who have already successfully completed their 12-month STP in a Data Analyst role do not have to re-take it.

Probation and Specialist Trial Period – Important Information
The Specialist Trial Period and Civil Service probation are run entirely separately. If you do not successfully complete your Specialist Trial Period and probation your employment with HMRC may be terminated.

If you fail the Specialist Trial Period but complete your probation you may be offered alternative, less specialised, roles within RIS. The decision on whether you are offered one of these roles will be based on several factors, including performance, behaviours and location, and it may be at a lower grade.

HMRC Software – Data Analysis Tool (Connect)

These Data Analyst roles involve the regular use of SAS technical software to manipulate and analyse large, complex data-sets, using a Data Analysis tool called Connect.

Connect combines two computer systems which present data in tables and as spider diagrams on screen, which means there is a strong visual aspect required to reviewing the data to identify patterns within it. Currently HMRC have no alternative IT solution which can present the full range of data in any other formats to the tables and spider diagrams.

Candidates should be aware the ability to use Connect effectively (following the provision of full training and any other reasonable adjustments) is essential for these roles.

Sift and interview dates to be confirmed.

Security Update

If you are successful and transferring from another Government Department, we will carry out a check of your identity, nationality, and immigration status (including the right to work in the UK) and a criminal record check before confirming your appointment.

Successful candidates must pass a Disclosure and Barring Security Check. Please note that HMRC have an exemption under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, which enables us to make enquiries about both unspent and spent convictions.

Data Governance Analyst

12 month fixed-term contract

£28,538 – £33,573 plus benefits Full Time 36 Hours

Location: Currently home based due to Covid 19 Lockdown measures

About us

Our vision is safe, effective and kind nursing and midwifery that improves everyone’s health and wellbeing. As the professional regulator of more than 710,000 nursing and midwifery professionals, we have an important role to play in making this a reality.

Our core role is to regulate. First, we promote high professional standards for nurses and midwives across the UK, and nursing associates in England. Second, we maintain the register of professionals eligible to practise. Third, we investigate when nursing or midwifery care goes wrong – something that affects less than one percent of professionals each year.

To regulate well, we support our professions and the public. We create resources and guidance that are useful throughout people’s careers, helping them to deliver our standards in practice and address new challenges. We also support people involved in our investigations, and we’re increasing our visibility so people feel engaged and empowered to shape our work.

Regulating and supporting our professions allows us to influence health and social care. We share intelligence from our regulatory activities and work with our partners to support workforce planning and sector-wide decision making. We use our voice to speak up for a healthy and inclusive working environment for our professions.

About the role

As a Data Governance Analyst, you will administer and analyse the processes and procedures associated with data capture, processing, and output to identify where data quality and data governance issues within the organisation exist, and work with the Data Owners and Stewards to mitigate risks and to ensure that data held across the NMC is accurate and of high quality. The post holder will also contribute to the effectiveness of the Data Governance Board in providing an efficient and high quality service for ensuring accurate source data across the NMC and will provide high-quality advice, guidance, problem solving and liaison across the NMC to establish the Data Governance framework and planning delivering for all activities within the project.

About you

The person we’re looking for has a willingness to challenge underlying assumptions and the status quo. You’ll have highly developed communication and influencing skills and be resilient and self-confident to drive through change. You’ll be confident working independently, problem solving, and speaking truth to power where needed.

You’ll have experience of working with similar issues – particularly around Data Quality or business analysis – knowledge or experience of preparing and presenting a wide range of complex information to a variety of stakeholders at all levels.

You’ll have a balance of skills – both technical (for example some basic SQL knowledge, and the ability to use BI tools like MS PowerBI), and interpersonal – for example presenting data and data topics to a non-technical audience, and influencing their decision making.

Most of all you’ll be a creative, analytical thinker – able to find their way around a perceived problem to the solution or root cause, and able to bring our stakeholders along with you as you do.

Why work for the NMC?

Our people are at the heart of everything we do. We aim to recruit the right people in the right places and we value the contribution they make to the success of our organisation. In return, we offer a comprehensive and competitive benefits package. To find out further information, please look at our benefits page.

We are looking for a 'Lead Data Engineer' to join the team. This is one of our first full-time non-founder roles, so the right person will quickly become a vital part of the original, early stage team.

We are not a big company (there's 6 of us at the moment). so it would be super important that you're comfortable working in a start-up environment, and are prepared to roll your sleeves up and get stuck into lots of potential tasks that need to be undertaken, irrespective of whether or not they are in the formal job spec.

Write high quality code to retrieve and analyze data
Analyze and solve our clients business problems at their root, stepping back to understand the broader context
Design pragmatic analyses and automated metrics that add value to our clients scenarios
Understand data resources and how, when, and what to use (and what not to use).
Develop analyses (whether fully formed or exploratory) for the business’ sake, not for analyses’ sake
Seek to understand the business objectives relevant to your area, and align your work to those objectives and seek to deliver business value
Preferred Qualifications/experience:
Previous technical internship(s)
Master’s or advanced technical degree
Experience with BI analytics/reporting/visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, AWS QuickSight, COGNOS, or other third-party tools)

Knowledge of algorithm design and complexity analysis
Ability to deal with ambiguity in a fast-paced environment

In return we are offering:
A competitive salary (£60K-£80K/year);
Annual bonus;
25 days annual leave;

Stuart sits at the crossroads of the future, using our best-in-class proprietary dispatch technology to connect small and big businesses alike to a shared fleet of geolocalised couriers. The result? Efficient, reliable, eco-friendly delivery to help retailers to meet their customers’ demands.

Kubrick Group is a specialist data consultancy with a twist. We hire a diverse range of junior professionals and graduates from across the country, we pay you while we train you in the latest data and business skills and then place you into industry-leading companies in a variety of different sectors. Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.

As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.

To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.

We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.

But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?

Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.

Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.

Your first 14-16 weeks at Kubrick Group are set aside for paid training in the skills you need to succeed in your career as a Data Management Analyst. You will work with experienced data governance practitioners and highly skilled technical trainers to:

Understand the commercial landscape and the regulatory drivers which are influencing management and governance of information now and in the future
Practice stakeholder management skills and adapting to an agile environment
Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau
Refine your skills working on real life projects to prepare you for being a consultant on client site.

You will also have access to the following soft skills workshops:

Presentation & interview skills and practice
Lunch and Learns – How to research your client before an interview?
Q&As with HQ Teams, Consultant on placements, Kubrick Alumni and Clients
Client Surgeries & Networking
Transition to Client Site
Career Management & Personal Value Statement

What we need from you:

A desire to work with multiple stakeholders and facilitating effective communication between them
A love for problem solving, making sense of something complex and communicating it to others in a way that is easy to understand
An ambition to work with data - don’t let it intimidate you, learning some coding is crucial in today’s age

12 month fixed-term contract

£28,538 – £33,573 plus benefits Full Time 36 Hours

Location: Currently home based due to Covid 19 Lockdown measures

About us

Our vision is safe, effective and kind nursing and midwifery that improves everyone’s health and wellbeing. As the professional regulator of more than 710,000 nursing and midwifery professionals, we have an important role to play in making this a reality.

Our core role is to regulate. First, we promote high professional standards for nurses and midwives across the UK, and nursing associates in England. Second, we maintain the register of professionals eligible to practise. Third, we investigate when nursing or midwifery care goes wrong – something that affects less than one percent of professionals each year.

To regulate well, we support our professions and the public. We create resources and guidance that are useful throughout people’s careers, helping them to deliver our standards in practice and address new challenges. We also support people involved in our investigations, and we’re increasing our visibility so people feel engaged and empowered to shape our work.

Regulating and supporting our professions allows us to influence health and social care. We share intelligence from our regulatory activities and work with our partners to support workforce planning and sector-wide decision making. We use our voice to speak up for a healthy and inclusive working environment for our professions.

About the role

As a Data Governance Analyst, you will administer and analyse the processes and procedures associated with data capture, processing, and output to identify where data quality and data governance issues within the organisation exist, and work with the Data Owners and Stewards to mitigate risks and to ensure that data held across the NMC is accurate and of high quality. The post holder will also contribute to the effectiveness of the Data Governance Board in providing an efficient and high quality service for ensuring accurate source data across the NMC and will provide high-quality advice, guidance, problem solving and liaison across the NMC to establish the Data Governance framework and planning delivering for all activities within the project.

About you

The person we’re looking for has a willingness to challenge underlying assumptions and the status quo. You’ll have highly developed communication and influencing skills and be resilient and self-confident to drive through change. You’ll be confident working independently, problem solving, and speaking truth to power where needed.

You’ll have experience of working with similar issues – particularly around Data Quality or business analysis – knowledge or experience of preparing and presenting a wide range of complex information to a variety of stakeholders at all levels.

You’ll have a balance of skills – both technical (for example some basic SQL knowledge, and the ability to use BI tools like MS PowerBI), and interpersonal – for example presenting data and data topics to a non-technical audience, and influencing their decision making.

Most of all you’ll be a creative, analytical thinker – able to find their way around a perceived problem to the solution or root cause, and able to bring our stakeholders along with you as you do.

Why work for the NMC?

Our people are at the heart of everything we do. We aim to recruit the right people in the right places and we value the contribution they make to the success of our organisation. In return, we offer a comprehensive and competitive benefits package. To find out further information, please look at our benefits page.

Mediahub - Lead Data Analyst,-1,"HELLO…We’re looking for a Lead Data Analyst

Who are we?

We’re Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.

It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.

Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG’s Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

We’re an open and friendly bunch (well that’s what people tell us) and we welcome others readily into our team. We hire people who challenge our thinking because diversity inspires originality.

What will you do?

Everything from getting involved in building business cases for clients, analysing large data sets, utilising machine learning techniques and models to scenario emulators to allow them to have the best outcome.

You will be a pro within a media agency workflow, understand platforms that we can buy adverts through (Facebook, Google, etc), have a familiarity with the data that comes out of these platforms, and what all of this data means for our clients.

We are a nimble team with big clout, the first to be involved in big projects (pitches, transformation, clients structural changes, client marketing changes) we shape and model what is being done.

Whether is out at a lunch, playing rounders at our sports days, focusing on independent learning, or being the resident Ping Pong champions, our culture is multifaceted. We want to bring in people that have something we don’t already have.

Requirements

About you

We are looking for someone who has a background working with Media campaign data and is looking for a chance to enhance their career by growing into a team leader role.

In a dream world you would be building something, a data product, coming up with new concepts to sell in data or a new way to look at data.

* Experience with one or more programming languages (R or Python) and the use of popular data analysis libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas, scikit learn)

* Competent user Web Analytics tools like Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics

* Good knowledge of ad-serving and media agency workflow

* Experience of statistics - descriptive statistics, regression, probability, sampling, hypothesis testing

Benefits

Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!

MullenLowe Group is a creatively driven integrated marketing communications network with a strong entrepreneurial heritage and challenger mentality. We are a global creative boutique of distinctive diverse agencies, rich in local culture with both intimacy and scale, present in more than 65 markets with over 90 agencies. We strongly believe better ideas come from talented people working together - we call this hyperbundling – and from it we produce cut through, effective and channel neutral solutions for our clients.

Our mission is simple: we aim to remove all barriers and enable entrepreneurs, brands and influencers to test and scale new product ideas and e-commerce businesses faster and further than ever before by digitalising traditional print environments stimulating the global adoption of print-on-demand.

Our platform allows clients to easily design new products and publish them instantly to the landing pages and highly customisable white-label e-commerce stores included within the Moteefe platform, or to a third-party e-commerce store solution of the client’s choice. Production is on-demand. This means that sales can be made before the item is produced. This agility transforms the economics of the supply chain.

Recognised by The Sunday Times Fast Track as one of the fastest growing tech companies in the UK and by Deloitte in 2020 as one of the fastest growing e-commerce businesses.

We truly believe in the power of human potential, that's why at Moteefe we give our employees

freedom to operate with their own entrepreneurial ambition. We strive for the best possible results by working as a team to enable partnerships across our community. These are our core values and beliefs. We encourage our employees to take as much annual leave as they need and are keen advocates in well-being with our flexible working from home policy, health is wealth! We ensure you have everything you need to do your job successfully, you can pick your own technical equipment that suits the way you work, whether that's in an office that is fully stocked with snacks to keep you going, or working from a coffee shop or from home.

What you’ll do with us:

You will be joining our Data team, and be key to transforming how the business leverages its data assets. Data and Analytics has been identified as a key enabler for the company to scale. Our vision is for decisions, investments, interventions and developments to be driven by robust measurement, analysis and insight across all business units. It’s an exciting part of our journey, and you have an opportunity to shape how we become truly ‘data-first’ as an organisation.

Working with a number of key teams across the business, you’ll understand the priorities and pain-points of our stakeholders and you’ll intuitively know how data and analysis can deliver impact for them. Metric-obsessed, you will focus on generating action orientated reports and insights; you’ll be adept at ‘storytelling with data’ and you’ll appreciate that an analyst doesn’t stop at the delivery of a report, but through ensuring that the insight is consumed and that the appropriate actions are taken as a result.

In addition, you will lead on the continuous development and management of a metrics framework, you’ll drive consistency of reporting across the business - ensuring that your stakeholders understand the metrics that matter and the levers that can move them. You’ll be the first port of call for metric forensics and - given you will be our metrics expert - you’ll strive to be ‘the first to understand’ fluctuations in business performance, through the setting-up of robust monitoring and alerting.

In short, this is a high-impact role for a highly communicative individual who is commercially astute and wants to be close to the decision-making part of the action. It’s the opportunity to make a difference and to define the data DNA of the company that will serve us well for years to come.

About the Role


The CRM team in Essity’s Application Management organization is responsible to deliver IT projects for sales and marketing and is running several CRM systems all over the world. It is the service provider for all business units selling Essity’s products to customers.

Essity is in the middle of a digital transformation, investing into new technologies and building a data lake for Essity’s data assets. The CRM team is a driving force in this transformation. The creation of a new team, enabling customer and consumer insight generation, is a reaction to the growing possibilities and demands on analyzing multi-source sales data.

As a Senior Business Analyst in the Customer & Consumer Insights team, you will run global projects with sales and marketing data in our data lake. You will be responsible solution owner for this section of the data lake, and you will support our business in creating and improving analyses and identifying data and harmonization issues. You will drive pre-studies and breakdowns of business requirements, conducting workshops to capture new requirements and you will give guidance on technologies and data sources.

Since this is a new role, you will be able to influence its shape and you will be an important part of developing our future ways of working. The overall aim is to support our stakeholders in becoming a successful data driven organization.

You will report to the IT Manager Customer & Consumer Insights within the CRM Service.

You help with the visualization of the data where feasible.

On the other hand, you are the communication channel into the technical data lake teams. You collaborate with data engineers, developers and platform subject matter experts to implement our vision. You follow the governance that is in place, coordinate parallel projects and get things delivered. You will need an understanding of databases, cloud storage and data visualization.

And we will ask you to coach, or mentor other less experienced colleagues.

Who You Are


You should be a person who enjoys learning new things and who applies technology to solve problems. The tools we are using are changing rapidly and we want to use them to their full potential.

It is important that you know how to be the link and the guiding light between data domain experts, business functions and IT specialists like Data Scientists and Data Engineers. You manage to navigate in a technical environment, and still you communicate well with all levels of the management hierarchy. And, you feel comfortable in an international environment with many different cultures involved.

Finally, you are happy to work with numbers and data and you enjoy the participation in and the ownership of highly paced analytics projects.
