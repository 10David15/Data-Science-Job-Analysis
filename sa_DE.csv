Together, we are upgrading the world of work to unleash the potential within and empower you to become the best possible version of yourself.

Upgrading the entire planet to a new financial system is a challenge of epic proportions. Like the first moon landing, it requires a special kind of people working together with unusual skill, focus and determination. We're changing the financial landscape, and to do so, well we need the best team on board for our mission. In short, to achieve our goals, we need rockstars. As simple as that.

A little about us:
We make it safe and easy to buy, store and learn about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
We currently have over 5 million customers across 40 countries.
We're part of the Digital Currency Group, a group of companies driving progress in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space that includes Grayscale, Genesis, Coindesk and Foundry Services.
Our platform has processed over $14 billion to date.
We're proud to be one of the world's most international cryptocurrency teams from 43 different nationalities — working across South Africa, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.

How we work


Our engineering team (currently ~100 engineers) is split into organisations which we call Fleets. Each Fleet focuses on a core customer journey (onboarding, security, payments, support, new business, growth and marketing etc.). Each of these fleets contains multiple smaller teams called Pods, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of the product.

Pods will include a product owner, product designer, back-end engineers, Android, iOS and Web developers, who each bring a unique perspective to the problem you are all contributing towards.

We're agile, use scrum, continuous integration and continuous delivery, deploying to production every single day.

We're building teams to help us succeed in our mission to upgrade the world to a better financial system. You'll be joining a group of highly motivated software engineers who you'll work collaboratively with across our pods.

As a fast-growing company with offices around the world, you'll immediately see how your contributions directly impact both our internal users and client experience. Many of the problems we are solving result in trail blazing solutions which can't be found on Stack Overflow; so we're looking for engineers who flourish working in a complex domain.

After getting comfortable with the basics, you'll start learning our idiomatic patterns in a safe, easy-to-follow way - by building your own toy micro services. You'll get to practice how we do design docs, code reviews, deployments, events, logging and monitoring.

You'll meet the Pod(s) you'll be working with and quickly align on the teams' current OKRs and product roadmap. We succeed as a team, so we will provide you with regular feedback from your manager and peers and will encourage you to do the same.

Your mission will involve:
Build distributed microservices that are accessed by 2.5m customers from across the globe.
Design, build and maintain advanced applications services.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features.
Write testable, maintainable code for robustness and reliability.
Work on bug fixing and improving application performance.
Write code that directly affects users, the company and the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The ideal candidate for this role will have:
A passion for blockchain and cryptocurrencies (this is a new industry so we'll help you learn about how the blockchain works and the technicals).
A proven background in computer science in areas such as algorithms, data structures, and software design.
Extensive programming experience in at least one language such as Go, Java, C++, C#, Python, etc.
A continuous improvement mindset.
BSc/MSc/PhD in computer science or other technical discipline, or equivalent working experience
A passion for software development, mobile technology and Bitcoin
To be friendly, transparent, articulate and driven to succeed
A work permit for South Africa if you are not a South African citizen

The world is changing.
We all want something different.
At Luno, we see you as individuals.

Together, we are upgrading the world of work to unleash the potential within and empower you to become the best possible version of yourself.

Upgrading the entire planet to a new financial system is a challenge of epic proportions. Like the first moon landing, it requires a special kind of people working together with unusual skill, focus and determination. We're changing the financial landscape, and to do so, well we need the best team on board for our mission. In short, to achieve our goals, we need rockstars. As simple as that.

A little about us:
We make it safe and easy to buy, store and learn about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
We currently have over 5 million customers across 40 countries.
We're part of the Digital Currency Group, a group of companies driving progress in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space that includes Grayscale, Genesis, Coindesk and Foundry Services.
Our platform has processed over $14 billion to date.
We're proud to be one of the world's most international cryptocurrency teams from 43 different nationalities — working across South Africa, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.

How we work


Our engineering team (currently ~100 engineers) is split into organisations which we call Fleets. Each Fleet focuses on a core customer journey (onboarding, security, payments, support, new business, growth and marketing etc.). Each of these fleets contains multiple smaller teams called Pods, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of the product.

Pods will include a product owner, product designer, back-end engineers, Android, iOS and Web developers, who each bring a unique perspective to the problem you are all contributing towards.

We're agile, use scrum, continuous integration and continuous delivery, deploying to production every single day.

We're building teams to help us succeed in our mission to upgrade the world to a better financial system. You'll be joining a group of highly motivated software engineers who you'll work collaboratively with across our pods.

As a fast-growing company with offices around the world, you'll immediately see how your contributions directly impact both our internal users and client experience. Many of the problems we are solving result in trail blazing solutions which can't be found on Stack Overflow; so we're looking for engineers who flourish working in a complex domain.

In your first six months, you will:


...start at Luno by learning our processes, meeting the wider team and starting our engineering on-boarding program. After getting comfortable with the basics, you'll start learning our idiomatic patterns in a safe, easy-to-follow way - by building your own toy micro services. You'll get to practice how we do design docs, code reviews, deployments, events, logging and monitoring.

You'll meet the Pod(s) you'll be working with and quickly align on the teams' current OKRs and product roadmap. We succeed as a team, so we will provide you with regular feedback from your manager and peers and will encourage you to do the same.

Your mission will involve:
Design, build and maintain advanced web applications using Angular and Typescript
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features
Write testable, maintainable code for robustness and reliability
Work on bug fixing and improving application performance
Write code that directly affects users, the company and the Bitcoin ecosystem
The ideal candidate for this role will have:
Extensive experience building high quality web applications
Be proficient in JavaScript (Typescript would be an added advantage)
A keen interest in mobile UX/UI design and Material Design
Experience with continuous integration and delivery technologies is an added advantage
BSc/MSc/PhD in computer science or other technical discipline, or equivalent working experience
A passion for software development, mobile technology and Bitcoin
To be friendly, transparent, articulate and driven to succeed
A work permit for South Africa if you are not a South African citizen
Don't be put off if you don't tick all of the boxes – they're a guide based on what we'd love to see but we appreciate that excellent software engineers have diverse backgrounds.

Remote Life at Luno


If you're looking to work on something truly global and disruptive with a forward-thinking and ambitious team that highly values diversity, teamwork, and the continuous quest for excellence, then this is an opportunity for you.

Like the majority of the companies, Luno is currently working remotely to keep our employees safe, which means you will not be physically, but virtually onboarded for now!
Live long and prosper. We've got you covered with excellent private medical insurance.
Generous maternity / paternity and even (yes, you are reading it correctly) paw-ternity for your furry friend..
Annual Inspiration Day.. like that pottery course you've always been meaning to do!
Work with a diverse team of hardworking, ambitious and friendly people on something that will truly revolutionise the financial world.
We are a social bunch of people, we have virtual quarterly activities and drinks Fridays for whoever wants to join!
We have virtual cooking, dancing, drawing and house planting classes hosted by our Lunauts Monthly to break up your day and work that other part of your brain.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. You'll need to hold the legal right to work in South Africa already as we cannot provide visa sponsorship.

You can create impactful visual content in just a few taps, with no design experience necessary. We've also recently joined forces withGoDaddyon its mission to radically shift the global economy toward life-fulfilling independent ventures.

At Over we believe that Creativity is the magical act of making change happen.
It's the power to reinvent yourself and the sorcery of making something out of nothing.
It's also the terror of a blank page; a rough destination with no directions.
But with the right tools, creativity turns any obstacle course into a playground.
So we take the hard parts out, so our users can focus on the joy of making change happen
Our users are ambitious, driven, and highly creative go-getters, entrepreneurs and dreamers, and we make it our mission to ensure they're equipped with the tools and knowledge to make their mark on the world whatever that may be.

We have an incredibly talented team of inspiring individuals, who have worked tirelessly to make Over into the wonderful product it is today. Together, we're inspiring the world to create, one design at a time.

At Over, we live and breathe these values and they show up in everything we do:
See it big keep it real We don't shy away from big ideas and crazy thinking that's where great things are made. But big ideas need clear plans. So we always come back to the problem, back to our why, back to the smaller steps. That's just how we roll
No mud; no lotus.
The road to reaching our mission is filled with ups and downs. And let's be real, sometimes we'll end up elbow deep in fertilizer before the good stuff grows. But the low points provide the teaching moments. So get your hands dirty. Just ... maybe wash them afterwards.
It's a playground, not an obstacle course. We're in the business of sparking ideas and encouraging big dreams, and you can't do that without a whole lotta play. And hey, life will give you lemons, but we say ""throw them back and play catch!"" That's how we make sure that when a problem comes knocking, we're ready to take it on.
Good hearts do great work
Good work comes from all types. But great work? That happens when we leave our egos at the door. When we speak the truth, listen hard, and take accountability for our actions. This is how we ensure that we make each other better. And better us = better outcomes.
You can't pour from an empty cup
Think big, work hard, push yourself, bring your A game but for the love of everything awesome, sit yo'self down and recharge. Eat the delicious thing. Get some vitamin D. It's called balance.
It takes a village What we do here? It takes all of us. It takes diverse thinking and fresh ideas. It takes trust in each other to do what we say we will. And it takes freedom to do our best work, whenever and wherever that is.
We say""thank you"".Like, a lot. For big things, small things, old things and new things. Our#gratitudeSlack channel is a constant reminder we're an overwhelmingly grateful bunch.

Become more at Entelect, one of SA’s leading software engineering and solutions companies, voted the Best Company to Work For.

When you join Entelect, you’re not just joining a leading software development company, you become part of something bigger. You become part of a team of ambitious, confident, motivated and smart people, who will inspire you to go further, to do more than you thought possible.

You become part of a company that sees potential: potential in our clients, potential in our products and potential in you. Because we believe that if we give you everything you need to be successful, you will be. That you will become more and do great things.

Entelect Software Engineer


As an Entelect Software Engineer working on the Microsoft stack, you’re basically a ninja. You’re fast becoming a master at Web API, MVC, JavaScript frameworks such as Angular or React and your ORM of choice (nHibernate or perhaps, Entity Framework). You’re comfortable creating applications for web, desktop and mobile. But we’re all ninjas here, so you’re in good company.

Your elevator pitch - what you’ll tell people you do


“I work with the best minds in the industry to solve complex business problems with software. I use my coding smarts to deliver the best solutions for my clients and my team so that we can deliver solutions with excellence and impact.”

What you’ll actually be doing
Joining a company with 2 decades’ experience in software craftsmanship; a company known for hiring, continuously growing, and retaining the best people in the industry.
Working with teams with a common goal: to solve complex business problems, to drive excellence and to make an impact, while pushing yourself and others to become more.
Using your knowledge and experience to develop world-class, high-quality web and mobile applications for some of the country’s leading organisations.
Getting involved in various parts of the SDLC – maybe having to do a bit of analysis, design and architecture work as part of your dev tasks.
Looking at ways to improve the quality of the product we ship through the use of containerisation and continuous integration to create a well-oiled DevOps process.
Researching cutting-edge technologies; and identifying ways to apply them into your project.
How you’ll do this
By leaning on your mastery of software engineering ninjutsu: best practices, clean code, design patterns and principles.
By working with the other deadly ninjas on your team; training, learning and sharing knowledge to complete your mission.
By understanding how the business and the technology can combine to add true value to your customer and project.
By pushing the limits, asking questions and challenging preconceived notions of what’s possible. Because, at Entelect, we believe everything is possible.
By being agile and planning properly, but being open and able to accommodate change when necessary. So you prioritise, you adjust and you get things done.
By having access to everything you need to become the best at what you do: the facilities, resources and autonomy you need to become more.
What we’ve worked on lately


At Entelect, we’re working on more than 80 projects at any given time. Here are some to whet your appetite:
Building loyalty platforms designed to drive consumer behaviour and help improve the health and wellness of South Africans.
Designing and developing high-performance web applications that enable multinational organisations to track risks, including fraud and white collar crime, across the globe, in real time.
Developing software for a surgical skill simulation portal that measures surgical skill proficiency; enabling trainee surgeons to practice, track and measure their skills remotely.
Imagining, designing and implementing an Android app for an agricultural company to help agronomists and sales agents share valuable data in real time; optimising smart agriculture solutions in an industry that is highly susceptible to minor fluctuations in conditions.
Helping one of South Africa’s largest vehicle fleet management companies accurately price project costs for hundreds of specialised vehicles, down to the cents per kilometre, to provide more competitive products to consumers.
Developing reliable processes, visual dashboards and tracking tools to monitor the delivery of schoolbooks across South Africa.
Learning and implementing complex tax and duty tracking tools that enable the world’s largest commodity traders to operate in multiple markets.
What your typical day could look like


You arrive at the office a bit earlier than normal to prepare for the Dojo that you will be hosting this afternoon. When the rest of the team arrives, you join them for the morning team coffee run, while discussing the social meet-up that’s happening tonight. You make a mental note to let your partner know that you’ll be out for dinner. That’s on us.

This morning’s stand up highlights a problem that a team member is facing. You volunteer to help them out. An hour of pair programming later, your team member is on the right track meaning you can move onto that other big ticket item you’ve been designing in your head for the past few days.

You put your headphones on and set about coding your design into a reality. After seeing that your unit tests pass, you commit and push…and watch in anticipation as the build monitor lets you know that it’s deployed. Awesome!

You have 20 minutes free before your demo, so you decide to knock off some technical debt. You spend the next hour having a successful demo with the customer and then rush off to a training session on event sourcing. With a happy customer and having learnt something new, you stop by the bar for a beer with your colleagues while deciding whether to stay for this evening’s LAN or head straight home.

Today was a good day. Tomorrow will be too.

.Net Core
Azure Cloud Services
ASP .Net MVC
Net WebAPI

What your typical day could look like


You arrive at the office and grab your favourite cup of coffee. You high five your colleagues, who are busy discussing the social meet-up that’s happening tonight. You make a mental note to let your partner know that you’ll be out for dinner. That’s on us.

You run through your mails, plan your day and prioritise. You join stand up for your Scrum team and bring your expertise to the table and assist in coming up with creative solutions to any technical problems that are present.

You head into a customer brainstorming session, where you discuss their ideas and bring your knowledge of global trends to the table, gained through the Entelect knowledge sharing sessions, to find the best insights for the team to produce.

Before grabbing lunch, you get side-tracked by a debate taking place in another squad regarding how to extract a certain set of data. You add your two cents, which proves to be super valuable and changes the direction of their project. More high fives and back pats. Good job!

You spend the next few hours building ETL’s/ELT’s, conforming data to enable a single version of the truth, analysing the data, and searching for insights to present back to business. Satisfied that you have added value to the client, you stop by the bar for a drink with your colleagues while deciding whether to stay for tonight’s social club or head straight home.

Become more at Entelect, one of SA’s leading software engineering and solutions companies, voted the Best Company to Work For.

When you join Entelect, you’re not just joining a leading software development company, you become part of something bigger. You become part of a team of ambitious, confident, motivated and smart people, who will inspire you to go further, to do more than you thought possible.

You become part of a company that sees potential: potential in our clients, potential in our products and potential in you. Because we believe that if we give you everything you need to be successful, you will be. That you will become more and do great things.

Entelect Software Engineer


As an Entelect Software Engineer working on a Java stack, you’re basically a wizard. You’re fast becoming a master at Spring, Java EE, JavaScript frameworks such as Angular or React and your ORM of choice (Hibernate or perhaps, MyBatis). You’re comfortable creating applications for web, desktop and mobile. But we’re all wizards here, so you’re in good company.

Your elevator pitch - what you’ll tell people you do


“I work with the best minds in the industry to solve complex business problems with software. I use my coding smarts to deliver the best solutions for my clients and my team so that we can deliver solutions with excellence and impact.”

What you’ll actually be doing
Joining a company with 2 decades’ experience in software craftsmanship; a company known for hiring, continuously growing, and retaining the best people in the industry.
Working with teams with a common goal: to solve complex business problems, to drive excellence and to make an impact, while pushing yourself and others to become more.
Using your knowledge and experience to develop world-class, high-quality web and mobile applications for some of the country’s leading organisations.
Getting involved in various parts of the SDLC – maybe having to do a bit of analysis, design and architecture work as part of your dev tasks.
Looking at ways to improve the quality of the product we ship through the use of containerisation and continuous integration to create a well-oiled DevOps process.
Researching cutting-edge technologies, and identifying ways to apply them into your project.
How you’ll do this
By leaning on your arcane knowledge of software engineering wizardry: best practices, clean code, design patterns and principles.
By working with the other master wizards in your team; training, learning and sharing knowledge to complete your quest.
By understanding how the business and the technology can combine to add true value to your customer and project.
By pushing the limits, asking questions and challenging preconceived notions of what’s possible. Because, at Entelect, we believe everything is possible.
By being agile and planning properly, but being open and able to accommodate change when necessary. So you prioritise, you adjust and you get things done.
By having access to everything you need to become the best at what you do: the facilities, resources and autonomy you need to become more.
What we’ve worked on lately


At Entelect, we’re working on more than 80 projects at any given time. Here are some to whet your appetite:
Building loyalty platforms designed to drive consumer behaviour and help improve the health and wellness of South Africans.
Designing and developing high-performance web applications that enable multinational organisations to track risks, including fraud and white collar crime, across the globe, in real time.
Developing software for a surgical skill simulation portal that measures surgical skill proficiency; enabling trainee surgeons to practice, track and measure their skills remotely.
Imagining, designing and implementing an Android app for an agricultural company to help agronomists and sales agents share valuable data in real time; optimising smart agriculture solutions in an industry that is highly susceptible to minor fluctuations in conditions.
Helping one of South Africa’s largest vehicle fleet management companies accurately price project costs for hundreds of specialised vehicles, down to the cents per kilometre, to provide more competitive products to consumers.
Developing reliable processes, visual dashboards and tracking tools to monitor the delivery of schoolbooks across South Africa.
Learning and implementing complex tax and duty tracking tools that enable the world’s largest commodity traders to operate in multiple markets.
What your typical day could look like


You arrive at the office a bit earlier than normal to prepare for the Dojo that you will be hosting this afternoon. When the rest of the team arrives, you join them for the morning team coffee run, while discussing the social meet-up that’s happening tonight. You make a mental note to let your partner know that you’ll be out for dinner. That’s on us.

This morning’s stand up highlights a problem that a team member is facing. You volunteer to help them out. An hour of pair programming later, your team member is on the right track meaning you can move onto that other big ticket item you’ve been designing in your head for the past few days.

You put your headphones on and set about coding your design into a reality. After seeing that your unit tests pass, you commit and push…and watch in anticipation as the build monitor lets you know that it’s deployed. Awesome!

Before grabbing lunch, you get side-tracked by a debate taking place in another squad regarding whether to go with Maven or Gradle. You add your two cents, excited to see the team moving forward onto the better performing Gradle setup. High fives and back pats all round. Good job!

You have 20 minutes free before your demo, so you decide to knock off some technical debt. You spend the next hour having a successful demo with the customer and then rush off to a training session on event sourcing. With a happy customer and having learnt something new, you stop by the bar for a beer with your colleagues while deciding whether to stay for this evening’s LAN or head straight home.

Today was a good day. Tomorrow will be too.

Now is the time to rebalance your world by semi-grating.

Semi-gration is an option for those who seek a better quality of life away from urban crime, congestion and the concrete jungle, to the smaller, safer, scenic places that will decrease stress and provide a better quality of life, without leaving South Africa.

Imagine working for a company who believes you should have a private life? A company who puts family values and happy employees as top priorities. Then imagine going for a walk on the beach, or in the forest. Imagine not having to sit in traffic, or spend 2+ hours of your day travelling. Then imagine, on top of all that, a company who has its focus on innovation and new technology. Salaries are based on ""big city"" market values so your lifestyle improves substantially.
