OS location data and expertise has helped governments make smarter decisions, businesses gain valuable data insight, and everyone experience the world outside for over 225 years.

Research Software Engineer

Background:

As a country and globally, we’re all experiencing challenging times right now, but Ordnance Survey (OS) continues to support the nation with our accurate geospatial data and services. As an organisation we are embarking on an ambitious growth strategy in location data, insight and services. Innovating our products, services and technology to benefit our customers, businesses and people across Great Britain and globally. In order to do this, we want to continue adding new skills and capabilities to our business and even in these tough times, we’re able to use technology to recruit talent to OS.

We are looking for a Research Software Engineer to join the highly successful Rapid Prototyping Team within Propositions and Innovation (P&I). This new function, created in January 2020, involves developing applications and products to gain customer feedback as quickly as possible, thereby enabling growth within the business. The team has been so effective this year, that we are recruiting again to further enhance our technical capabilities. Recent Prototypes have included an automatic vegetation encroachment classifier (for utilities companies) and a framework for modelling the geospatial spread of disease (for health services). Though the type of work will vary every month, each project will be grounded by the team’s robust approach to software engineering.

Imagine working for a team where your opinion and creative problem-solving skills are the prized assets. Agility is the order of the day and no time will be lost chasing impossible targets or dead-end projects. There has never been a better time to be an innovator at Ordnance Survey: complete national coverage of topography means we have direct access to trusted data; our Python Developers are making machine learning models implementable in a few lines of code; Cloud Computing investments have made national scale models possible at the push of a button. The Prototyping Team has galvanized all the best aspects of innovation at Ordnance Survey and provided real people with real solutions in real time. If you’re a skilled Engineer who is able to design software rapidly to enable new research, this is a fantastic opportunity to join our fun and dynamic Prototyping Team.

About the Role:

We are looking for a Research Software Engineer to develop rapid but robust solutions to customer problems within the Prototyping Team. Whilst Engineering Principles are encouraged whenever possible, sometimes there will be a need to strike a pragmatic balance between ideal practices and rapid prototyping. To this end, you will have experience in Python Development – in particular, marrying off-the-shelf libraries with bespoke code. The majority of Prototypes will involve manipulating geospatial data in some way, so experience with geodatabases would be a bonus.

To meet the research aims of the team, you may be required to identify key partners from academia and industry. Some projects may benefit from external collaboration or result in the publication of papers in journals; you will play a key part in guiding these processes.

To meet the technical aims of the team, you will need to have a broad set of existing skills, along with the ability to pick up new ones quickly. In particular, we may have benefited from an engineer with experience in Hadoop/Spark/SQL/JavaScript/PHP in previous projects. You do not have to be an expert in any of these frameworks/languages, but a solid grasp of current technical ecosystems would be useful in informing decisions.

There will be plenty of opportunity for your work to be championed directly to internal stakeholders and it is important that you are able to integrate well with the friendly Ordnance Survey community. Moreover, there may arise occasions to present internationally or even patent the technology you are developing, which will be generously rewarded. We recognise that working at the forefront of innovation may require training, so there will be ample opportunity to up-skill in some of the most interesting areas of technology.

Responsibilities:

Co-lead the engineering of short-term (1-3 months) projects with a small team of python developers and data scientists
Identify and deliver effective training, proactively sharing best practices with the rest of the Prototyping Team
Lead on collaborative work with internal and external partners to identify, develop and implement prototype opportunities
Provide technical leadership on decisions relating to the architecture and design of software
Interface with customers (internally and externally) to make sure the solution is technically fit for purpose with the potential to become operational
Identify project risks and effectively mitigate these using appropriate test suites
Explain risks and dependencies to stakeholders in a clear way
Lead and take part in Mob-Programming sessions with the Team

Essential Skills

At least two years’ experience with high-level programming languages (ideally Python)
Ability to work at pace and approach new problems creatively

To be the successful person you will need to be able to demonstrate the following

Expert knowledge and skills in software engineering and industry best practice, including design patterns
Proven track record of supporting the effective delivery of R&D projects
Track record of effectively communicating technical subjects to non-technical audiences
Experience of designing code architecture for greenfield projects as well as refactoring legacy code

Predictive techniques (e.g. Machine Learning) and big data manipulation (e.g. Spark)
Agile Software Development
Full stack development
Geospatial techniques (PostgreSQL / GeoPandas / GDAL)

Our go-to programming languages for backend services are C# and Python, but we use other technologies when the challenge we are working on calls for it (Golang and Rust);
Most of our data pipelines currently use Python, Spark and Hive, sometimes orchestrated with Airflow (but often glued together with BASH);
Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, hosted in AWS;
Monitoring using a combination of the ELK stack, Jaeger, and Prometheus/Grafana.

Develop and deliver training on SQL, Python, data visualisation practices, and more
The role

We're looking for someone who is skilled at and motivated by helping to make and enable sound organisational decisions using quantitative data.

'Making' in the sense that you'll often be tasked to conduct rigorous analysis, using a variety of tools, to deliver meaningful insights. 'Enabling' in the manner that you're excited to help mentor and coach others in their own analytics efforts, and possess the skills to help bring greater consistency and robustness to our data sources and analytical workflows.

This role is technical in that it requires use of a diverse array of techniques and technologies to extract and prepare high-quality analysis. At the same time, there is a great deal of flexibility in your ability to focus on a subset of our team's broad mission and grow your skill set accordingly, whether that's in rigorous project management, deep statistical analysis, or robust pipeline engineering.

As a group we want to enhance the way DeepMind as a whole makes decisions and takes action, so there are many different ways team members can further this aim.

A core set of the responsibilities this role encompasses:

Work with partners to identify relevant high-level business questions and propose relevant data-focused analysis

Submit tested code into source control for review
Coach and mentor others in their own use of analytical tools and technique
About you

What we are looking for in the ideal candidate:

You excel at analytical problem solving with a 'nose for data', knowing which questions to ask of it, how to go about answering those questions, and how to ensure that your answer is correct.

You enjoy using a variety of technical tools to answer the question at hand. You recognise that there are lots of potential ways to approach a problem, and enjoy choosing the right tool for the job. You enjoy learning new technologies and techniques when appropriate.

You consider yourself 'business savvy'. You have proven experience working with various internal partners, and an intuition for which questions are most important to hone in on in service of our mission.

You are passionate about 'storytelling' with data. You're great at translating deeply technical analysis into insights and conclusions that everyone can grasp, independent of prior context or expertise. You know how to optimally express uncertainty in your conclusions, and key assumptions that have gone into the analytical process.

Qualities that are an asset

You are comfortable extracting and manipulating data via SQL (especially BigQuery and Google's StandardSQL implementation) and Python and the PyData stack (e.g. Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy, NumPy, Jupyter)
You might be familiar with some other aspects of ETL management (e.g. Apache Beam, Apache Spark, Airflow, Luigi), data modelling (e.g. DBT, Snowflake), and data visualisation (e.g. Tableau, Data Studio, d3.js, Matplotlib, Vega, Altair, etc.), or are at least excited to learn more
You like to 'work quantitatively', and have at least a basic solid understanding of statistical concepts that let you express ambiguity in your analysis and assumptions
You've previously taught yourself new tools/techniques to expand your skillset
You have experience partnering with senior decision-makers in a professional setting
You consistently strive to see 'beyond the data' and understand what your analysis represents in terms of actual reality/experience
You enjoy collaborating widely, and partnering with others to empower action and change

If you don't think you embody all of the above criteria, please still seriously consider applying! This role (and therefore the requirements) is broad, and we'd be excited to discuss how you see yourself contributing across it!

A word from us


Everybody likes to say they’re different...

Newton was founded to buck the norm in management consultancy - to demand better for its clients. Because, for us, change doesn’t come from behind a laptop. It comes from getting under the skin of an organisation and learning first-hand how it ticks. It’s not about producing reports that gather dust on a boardroom’s top shelf; it’s about delivering results that actually work.We crack some of the biggest challenges that businesses and public sector organisations face.

We’re called upon to bring much-needed change, from redesigning social care to improving build efficiencies on aircraft carriers. The work’s varied and complex - just how we like it. And no one else does it quite like we do. Take our business model. We guarantee our fees against delivering results, and will only leave once our clients see those results stick. Bold - yes. Disruptive? Always.

Blindingly fast career progression means that if you show you’re ready to step up - you’ll be promoted. Because we recognise talent, not tenure. And with all the support, training, and development you need, there’s really no stopping you. No matter the role you join in, you’ll be surrounded by spirited, naturally curious people. People who want to learn from you, and who’ll also teach you a thing or two along the way. It’s how everyone goes further, faster.

Your expertise will be instrumental in building and scaling out a platform that combines vast quantities of real-time data with domain-leading machine learning to deliver real impact to more than 100 million users worldwide.

What are we looking for?

Our existing team covers a wide variety of different skills and we’re looking to broaden this yet further. Here are a few broad areas in which our team works. Can you picture yourself having an impact in one of these areas? Do you have an eagerness to advance your knowledge in one or more of these areas? Please highlight this when applying.
APIs and services: Building fast, flexible APIs and the data processing that underpins them. Designing APIs to be used by a variety of users – from cooks across the world, to internal users like engineers and community managers. Building libraries, services, and tooling that accelerate the pace of delivery.
Search at scale: Deep knowledge of the Elasticsearch query DSL and performance tuning for real-time applications at global scale. Skills in data exploration using Kibana.

A typical day might include any of the following:
Implement and deploy a new experimental HTTP API endpoint to test an unproven feature concept against our existing baseline (and being prepared to fail fast, revert and rethink!).
Implement a change in system architecture to improve an onerous or error prone area of development, subsequently helping the team make the most of the change.
Explore API performance to further improve response times while still ensuring results are hyper-relevant for every user.
Refactor a section of code to fix the flaky test that seems to intermittently fail, especially when you want to release something new and exciting to production.
Review another team member’s PR, offering “must”, ”should”, “could”, and “would” guidance that finds the sweet spot between delivery and improvement.
Add a step to CI to automate an element of PR review, freeing team time to spend on other development work.
Requirements

Who you are:
You have substantial experience of working in a software team delivering features at pace.
You love writing software using Python. You deliver tested, reliable, and maintainable software.

Company + Benefits*
GSAe is an engineering consultancy and process technology provider that has worked in the area of metals extraction since the mid-1990’s when work began to develop and install the world’s first batch hydrometallurgy plant to extract vanadium and nickel oxides from ash produced in European power stations using Orimulsion ™ as a fuel.

In order to use Orimulsion™, strict environmental permits were required to ensure that the ash was dealt with responsibly. Oil (and hence the Orimulsion™ fuel) contains trace amounts of various metals, including vanadium and nickel. These are concentrated through refining in the heavy residues and then into the ash when used as a fuel. Nickel oxides are classified as a category 1 carcinogen; vanadium oxides as a mutagen and so the disposal route could not be to landfill. GSAe developed a route to recover these oxides which would allow the fuel to be used. A plant utilising the batch techniques was built in Harwich, UK and successfully operated multiple nickel and vanadium bearing feed materials such as Flexicoke and spent catalysts until the transport of dangerous goods act made it impossible to receive feed material in 2010.

Since 2010, GSAe has built on the knowledge and understanding gained during the operation of this plant and adapted into the technology company. Significant research and development has led to new routes for the treatment of hydrocarbon residues, spent refinery catalysts, HFO ashes and, latterly TiO2 wastes.

GSAe has significant IP in hydrocarbon processing, metals extraction and now holds patents for recovering vanadium; scandium and niobium from TiO2 residues produced using the chloride process and is in the process of submitting a similar application for sulphate route residues.

Projects under development are based in Europe, the Middle East, Australia and North America.

We are looking for entrepreneurs with the ambition of owning and running a start-up in a beautiful part of the UK.*

We’re working towards connecting this community so small-scale farmers can gain a better position in global agricultural supply chains. Some of the world’s leading VCs are backing us on this mission, including True Ventures in Silicon Valley.

Since our launch in 2015, we’ve grown to serve over two million farmers across Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Our platform has facilitated the (free) exchange of over 18 million messages to share knowledge, generated over $5 million in marketplace sales, and sold nearly half a million products. So far, we’ve partnered with 100+ brands to give our members fair prices on the quality products they are looking for.

Our next milestone is to have 100 million farmers benefiting from Wefarm. Join us and be part of our mission to build an ecosystem for global agriculture, with the farmer at the centre.

The Role

We are looking for a Data Engineer to join our growing technical team, as our first full-time hire in this field.

You must be self-directed, and comfortable supporting the data needs of multiple teams, including developers, BI, and data scientists, enabling Wefarm to use data to build insight, grow the company, and support the needs of our farmers.

There is a rich, vibrant, and open culture within Wefarm. Even though we are separated geographically, we maintain a highly collaborative and communicative outlook and are keen to maintain this as we expand into new roles and new territories.

Essential Duties

Build and maintain ELT (extract-load-transform) pipelines to get data from various systems and databases into our existing Snowflake data lake
Build and maintain SQL (and non-SQL) data transformations to enrich our data, including using DBT as the transformation step within our data lake
Enable stakeholders, including the BI, Product, and Growth teams, to get access to the data they need to perform their duties
Collaborate with Product Development teams to research and develop new data infrastructure projects, and architect reliable, accurate, and useful data schemas which can work for both operational and reporting purposes
Work across the company on data-related technical issues, and monitor database usage and performance to maximise efficiency
Ensure data security and data protection regulatory compliance by implementing optimal access policies and following industry best practice

A successful history of manipulating and processing large disconnected unstructured datasets, and enabling others to use data to build value
Advanced SQL (PostgreSQL and Snowflake)
Working knowledge of Git and GitHub
Working knowledge of message queuing, stream processing, and highly scalable ‘big data’ data stores (e.g. SQS, Kafka, Snowflake)

The company and our mission:

BridgeU was founded with the belief that talent is equally distributed across the globe, but opportunity is not. We take pride in helping students discover and explore the best pathways available to them - wherever those opportunities may be. We help universities to discover and attract the schools and students that will contribute to their vibrant, diverse and successful programs and courses.

In the fast-changing world of education, and in the ‘new normal’ in the wake of Covid-19, we believe BridgeU had never been more important to help students, schools and universities discover new opportunities globally and connect at a distance.

Today, BridgeU is the market leading provider of university and careers guidance software to international and globally-minded secondary schools. BridgeU is proud to work with secondary schools in over 300 cities across 119 countries. And, we partner with a quickly-growing number of leading universities, currently in 8 countries, to connect recruitment and admissions teams to the largest community of international schools available on one platform.

BridgeU has the approach and pace of a start-up, where there are always opportunities to try something new and grow, with, since early 2020, the support and stability of being part of Kaplan International, part of one of the world’s largest and most diverse education providers.

Who you’ll be working with:

Our teammates are talented people that come from a variety of backgrounds. We’re committed to building an inclusive culture based on trust and kindness, which creates a good work environment that helps enrich both the product and the support we provide to our customers.

We currently have offices in London, Madrid and Hong Kong as well as fully remote employees. Since March 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, BridgeU’s whole team has become a fully remote workforce, and we are aiming to continue a remote-first culture even when our offices do re-open. This role could be office-based or fully remote, and could be based anywhere in either the UK or in Spain.

In normal times we aim to travel regularly between our offices to have face-to-face time with other team members to bond, work together and have some fun. We’re aiming to get back to this in a post-Covid world as soon as is feasible. In the meantime, we’ve been socialising, playing games, hosting quizzes, and other things, online so that we stay connected to one another.

What’s the opportunity?

We are looking for a smart and enthusiastic new member to join our data team. The distinction between Data Scientists and Engineers can often be a bit blurred, particularly when working in a startup, and our ideal candidate would be happy working in both areas. If you’re looking for a role where you’ll be solving challenging engineering problems one day, and have the opportunity to develop a new ML model the next, then this job might be perfect for you.

What you’ll be doing…

Life in a startup is naturally very varied, and in a small data team you’ll have opportunities to do both Data Science and Engineering. The following are all areas we have been particularly involved with in the last two years, so you can expect to work on several of the below:
Improving our university and course recommendations, using machine learning to find best-fit higher education options for students.
Building the infrastructure that enables us to standardise university data from a wide range of sources, and automate keeping everything up to date.
Creating a platform for school analytics, enabling schools to understand the factors that impact their students’ success.
Developing new techniques that make use of various data sources to link students’ degrees and interests with potential jobs and career pathways.
Writing and reviewing production code (mostly in Python). Our data team is responsible for gathering and cleaning raw university and course data, running our recommendations services, and developing models.
Building models to help the Customer Success team predict the ‘health’ of school accounts, based on site usage, and account data.
10% Investment time - working on anything that you think might add to BridgeU’s appeal / improve our working processes. This can include studying topics of interest and learning from or educating the rest of the team.
Creatively solving a variety of other business problems - you will be working in a small team of four people in a fast growing, data-informed Startup, so will have regular and varied challenges. Every day ends up being a bit different!
We have created an environment where collaboration and learning are highly encouraged, trusting each others’ decisions and empowering autonomy. Our development process involves paired programming sessions and code reviews that give us the opportunity to learn something new and bring useful discussions every day. We are committed to supporting the movement towards a fully remote, distributed team and the way we communicate with each other reflects this long-term goal.

Requirements

What you’ll bring:
Strong programming skills (particularly Python, SQL, Git)
The ability (and desire) to work as part of a development team. Experience with agile software development, code-review, pair-programming, software-testing, CI and CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) are all a bonus.
Experience working with real world data. You don’t have to be a Data Scientist, but you should understand the complexities of dealing with and cleaning messy data.
Some familiarity with using data and machine learning packages in Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn etc.).
Understanding of cloud-based ETL / data pipelining architectures is a big plus (we currently use Google DataFlow, BigQuery and Apache Beam, but understanding of alternatives is fine).
Experience with the Data Science process / applying Machine Learning models is a big plus, although not required if you are a strong data engineer.
Pragmatism. There is always lots of important stuff to do, and whilst we always want to produce work of the highest quality, the ability to balance this with the needs of a fast moving startup is crucial.
Creativity. Often the ideal data isn’t available, or there are limitations that prevent the use of standard approaches. You will need the ability to come up with novel solutions to problems, and go out in search of data or knowledge that we may not already have.
Enthusiasm and positivity! The friendly culture at BridgeU is very important to us, and we believe that a positive attitude goes a long way.
Benefits

What the company provides:
Competitive salary based on your experience
Personal development: the company can fund books, courses and conferences that can help you learn and grow.
Investment time: every two weeks on Friday we spend time learning or collaborating on projects that can benefit the company or the community.
Opportunities for flexible working hours, encouraging everyone to have a healthy work-life balance and striving to create an environment that is inclusive for everyone, including working parents
Annual offsite: we organise a retreat once a year where the whole company gets together (we did this remotely this year)
Regular socials with the whole team
A comfortable and Covid-secure office space in Angel, N1, or in Madrid, should you wish to use it
Career progression and development
Employer’s pension scheme
An open and democratic work culture where everyone can contribute, learn and teach

Excellent SQL skills are required, and knowledge of window functions, optimising queries, geospatial queries, GIS, and general data wrangling are a must.

We are open to people from a diverse range of backgrounds and would have a preference for people with an understanding of most of the following:

Python/Go for data collection
Postgres and PostGIS
AWS Glue/S3/RDS/EC2
Spark/Scala is nice to have but not required initially

We are looking for someone with proven experience of data collection and data pipelines, and who is comfortable working with stakeholders and directly with the CTO and Product Owner. We are a relatively small team, so you must be comfortable with conversing across all aspects of development and reacting quickly to new information.",4.9,"REalyse

graze started in 2008 as a healthy snack subscription service, delivering customised boxes of snacks directly to customers through the post. At the time, there were very few platforms to help us with such a novel idea, so we built our own: from factory machines and systems, to a subscription website and data warehouse.

Ever since those early start-up days, technology and data have always been important in driving our success. Our ability to rapidly develop and iterate tech solutions has been a vital ingredient of our launches into eCommerce and retail, helping us to establish ourselves one of the UK's healthiest snack brands!

In 2019 we were acquired by Unilever, and we're now expanding into Europe. We've already launched graze into Ireland and the Netherlands - and that's just the beginning...

The role, Data Engineer...

Were looking for a Data Engineer to provide technical leadership in our Data team. You will be responsible for managing our data warehouse platform, building and maintaining data pipelines, and designing and delivering technical solutions to business problems.

Our tech stack...

Our AWS Redshift data warehouse is populated by a custom-built batch job scheduling system, which orchestrates hundreds of ETL processes per day. The wealth of data that comes from a vertically-integrated and multi-market consumer goods business means that our pipelines are really diverse... we have processors that deal with anything from ingesting subscription website session data, to retailer sales data, to product weight data from the production lines in our factory!

Our data platform is primarily written in PHP, deployed on Docker on AWS ECS, and we rely on other AWS services like S3, RDS and SQS. Business users can download and upload data via self-serve tools in our internal web application, as well as Tableau dashboards.

Its now been 10 years since graze made our first data hire. A lot has changed in this time, and were always looking for ways to further improve our data systems. Which parts of our system continue to drive real value to the business - how can we make these better? What new tools are out there that were not yet using? Should we migrate our customer-built batch job scheduling to Airflow? We are looking for someone who is excited to get involved in answering these big questions and defining the technical direction that we move in!

What we are looking for in you
Youre curious! You have an ability to quickly learn and adapt, with fast problem-solving capabilities
You have experience in building and maintaining data platforms and pipelines
You love to write clean, efficient, maintainable, version-controlled and well-documented code
You have excellent SQL skills
You enjoy working with end users to build and deploy quality solutions that are valuable to them and the business

Gain enough familiarity with the existing codebase that you can comfortably make and review significant changes.
Be instrumental in scoping and specifying changes to the systems.
Be able to identify areas of improvement and progress changes.
Be able to respond to, triage and fix most operational issues.
Build strong relationships with your team and key people you work with.
Whats in it for you?
A competitive salary, BUPA private medical insurance and pension scheme
25 days holiday + 1 health day + 1 volunteering day, per year
Flexible working - throughout 2020, weve all been working from home. We will continue to offer flexible working in future, allowing for a balance between office and remote working days.
Hacker Time: one day per month dedicated to hacking away (no distractions!) on whatever youd like, learning a new language, trying out some new tech, open sourcing some code
We encourage active learning with learning lunches, networking events or more formal qualifications
Opportunities for presenting on technical subjects, in learning and conference-style environments both internally and externally
Plenty of free snacks!
Were all about inclusivity and making you feel like you belong. We are passionate about having an excellent culture with strong meaningful values so the biggest ask we have is for you to be your authentic self every day whilst doing a great job.

Realtime Transport Data Engineer (remote),-1,"Citymapper makes cities usable, helping people move through urban spaces, getting people from A to B.

We have launched in more than 60 cities so far. We've found that having a broad and deep set of data on the transportation options in that city is key to ensuring a great experience for our users.

We are launching many new cities to bring Citymapper to users everywhere.

We provide essential information for millions of users, letting them know when the next bus is arriving, which trains are disrupted, and what time they should leave to get home. We need engineers to help build and maintain the systems that do that.

Good transport data, especially realtime information, is why our users love our app.

What you’ll do
Add and maintain sources of realtime departure information in new and existing cities. Lots of feeds and cities require non-trivial and unique strategies in order to reliably show the correct departure times to the user. ""When does my bus arrive?""
Find ways to turn disruption messages from agencies into useful notifications and re-routing for our users. Check out what we did in NYC. ""Is the metro blue line running?""
Integrate private transport operators into our data streams. Public transport is being complemented by private transport operators in most of the cities we cover - bikes, moped, scooters, cars, etc... ""Where's the nearest electric bike to rent?""
Improve the monitoring and operational systems necessary to keep these 100s of realtime data feeds working. ""Why are we not showing trains in Lyon?""
Fun projects we recently took on
Deployed a real time monitoring system to help commuters in Hong Kong navigate complex route diversions
Built a system to approximate TfL train predictions based on sparse data
Added real time crowdedness information to help users decide which vehicle to use
Requirements

Ultimately we don’t have hard requirements beyond needing you to be smart, curious, and keen to get stuck in.

The company and our mission:

BridgeU was founded with the belief that talent is equally distributed across the globe, but opportunity is not. We take pride in helping students discover and explore the best pathways available to them - wherever those opportunities may be. We help universities to discover and attract the schools and students that will contribute to their vibrant, diverse and successful programs and courses.

In the fast-changing world of education, and in the ‘new normal’ in the wake of Covid-19, we believe BridgeU had never been more important to help students, schools and universities discover new opportunities globally and connect at a distance.

Today, BridgeU is the market leading provider of university and careers guidance software to international and globally-minded secondary schools. BridgeU is proud to work with secondary schools in over 300 cities across 119 countries. And, we partner with a quickly-growing number of leading universities, currently in 8 countries, to connect recruitment and admissions teams to the largest community of international schools available on one platform.

BridgeU has the approach and pace of a start-up, where there are always opportunities to try something new and grow, with, since early 2020, the support and stability of being part of Kaplan International, part of one of the world’s largest and most diverse education providers.

Who you’ll be working with:

Our teammates are talented people that come from a variety of backgrounds. We’re committed to building an inclusive culture based on trust and kindness, which creates a good work environment that helps enrich both the product and the support we provide to our customers.

We currently have offices in London, Madrid and Hong Kong as well as fully remote employees. Since March 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, BridgeU’s whole team has become a fully remote workforce, and we are aiming to continue a remote-first culture even when our offices do re-open. This role could be office-based or fully remote, and could be based anywhere in either the UK or in Spain.

In normal times we aim to travel regularly between our offices to have face-to-face time with other team members to bond, work together and have some fun. We’re aiming to get back to this in a post-Covid world as soon as is feasible. In the meantime, we’ve been socialising, playing games, hosting quizzes, and other things, online so that we stay connected to one another.

What’s the opportunity?

We are looking for a smart and enthusiastic new member to join our data team. The distinction between Data Scientists and Engineers can often be a bit blurred, particularly when working in a startup, and our ideal candidate would be happy working in both areas. If you’re looking for a role where you’ll be solving challenging engineering problems one day, and have the opportunity to develop a new ML model the next, then this job might be perfect for you.

What you’ll be doing…

Life in a startup is naturally very varied, and in a small data team you’ll have opportunities to do both Data Science and Engineering. The following are all areas we have been particularly involved with in the last two years, so you can expect to work on several of the below:
Improving our university and course recommendations, using machine learning to find best-fit higher education options for students.
Building the infrastructure that enables us to standardise university data from a wide range of sources, and automate keeping everything up to date.
Creating a platform for school analytics, enabling schools to understand the factors that impact their students’ success.
Developing new techniques that make use of various data sources to link students’ degrees and interests with potential jobs and career pathways.
Writing and reviewing production code (mostly in Python). Our data team is responsible for gathering and cleaning raw university and course data, running our recommendations services, and developing models.
Building models to help the Customer Success team predict the ‘health’ of school accounts, based on site usage, and account data.
10% Investment time - working on anything that you think might add to BridgeU’s appeal / improve our working processes. This can include studying topics of interest and learning from or educating the rest of the team.
Creatively solving a variety of other business problems - you will be working in a small team of four people in a fast growing, data-informed Startup, so will have regular and varied challenges. Every day ends up being a bit different!
We have created an environment where collaboration and learning are highly encouraged, trusting each others’ decisions and empowering autonomy. Our development process involves paired programming sessions and code reviews that give us the opportunity to learn something new and bring useful discussions every day. We are committed to supporting the movement towards a fully remote, distributed team and the way we communicate with each other reflects this long-term goal.

Requirements

What you’ll bring:
Strong programming skills (particularly Python, SQL, Git)
The ability (and desire) to work as part of a development team. Experience with agile software development, code-review, pair-programming, software-testing, CI and CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) are all a bonus.
Experience working with real world data. You don’t have to be a Data Scientist, but you should understand the complexities of dealing with and cleaning messy data.
Some familiarity with using data and machine learning packages in Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn etc.).
Understanding of cloud-based ETL / data pipelining architectures is a big plus (we currently use Google DataFlow, BigQuery and Apache Beam, but understanding of alternatives is fine).
Experience with the Data Science process / applying Machine Learning models is a big plus, although not required if you are a strong data engineer.
Pragmatism. There is always lots of important stuff to do, and whilst we always want to produce work of the highest quality, the ability to balance this with the needs of a fast moving startup is crucial.
Creativity. Often the ideal data isn’t available, or there are limitations that prevent the use of standard approaches. You will need the ability to come up with novel solutions to problems, and go out in search of data or knowledge that we may not already have.
Enthusiasm and positivity! The friendly culture at BridgeU is very important to us, and we believe that a positive attitude goes a long way.
Benefits

What the company provides:
Competitive salary based on your experience
Personal development: the company can fund books, courses and conferences that can help you learn and grow.
Investment time: every two weeks on Friday we spend time learning or collaborating on projects that can benefit the company or the community.
Opportunities for flexible working hours, encouraging everyone to have a healthy work-life balance and striving to create an environment that is inclusive for everyone, including working parents
Annual offsite: we organise a retreat once a year where the whole company gets together (we did this remotely this year)
Regular socials with the whole team
A comfortable and Covid-secure office space in Angel, N1, or in Madrid, should you wish to use it
Career progression and development
Employer’s pension scheme
An open and democratic work culture where everyone can contribute, learn and teach
Equal Opportunities

We are a global team with a global mindset, cherishing and protecting diversity as one of our core values. We are always looking to diversify the talent in our team and with that in mind would especially encourage applications from female candidates, and any candidates from an ethnic minority background.

Data Engineer,-1,"Description

Our Data, Analytics & Intelligence team are at the core of the latest developments and key decisions within our business. They’re a constantly expanding team and currently on the lookout for a Data Engineer to join them on a permanent basis.

Our team are driven by a passion to help make a tangible and lasting difference in people’s lives through the innovative transformation of our products, and you’ll have that same passion.

Within this role, you’ll hold responsibility for the creation and maintenance of a logical data model, integrating data from multiple data sources in to a central Enterprise data warehouse. You’ll be able to design and apply data cleansing and data standardisation rules, providing clear documentation of the business rules embedded in the system, with the potential of solving data quality issues.

Whilst you’ll have a variety of stakeholders, you’ll work closely with the wider Data team to understand what the data journey needs to look like (conversion, processing, etc), specifically working closely with the Data Architect to create an overview of the data lineage.

Please note this role will initially be working from home, with a shift to a hybrid office/home working set up as lockdown restrictions evolve. We’re also committed to the work/life balance of our teams, so we’re happy to consider flexible working options.

Qualifications

You’ll feel at ease advising on the use of data for actionable analytics, and also share our passion for putting our customers first with the end user being at the forefront of your decisions.

As the role offers a healthy level of autonomy, you’ll thrive working with minimal guidance, and feel comfortable using your own initiative. You’ll apply your analytical thinking to ensure effective problems solving.

This will include writing HTML, CSS, Ruby and JavaScript to deliver new features for our users, as well as refactoring our codebase to make it more pleasant and productive to work on.

You’ll be comfortable writing modular code and thinking about how your work fits into the big picture, and collaborating with our data engineers to make use of our reporting and analysis.

You’ll have strong communication skills, and be comfortable discussing problems and solutions with your team-mates. You’ll be asked to give your input & ideas to help make decisions and shape features via design sprints, planning, story mapping and other product development activities.

You’ll enjoy learning, teaching & sharing your experience with your colleagues in various ways; we encourage code review, pairing, mentoring, giving (and watching!) regular lightning talks, and getting & giving regular feedback.

Requirements

We’re looking for people with experience with Ruby, preferably using the Rails framework. Experience with JavaScript, and with React in particular, would also be valuable.

Software Engineer interview process
We do an initial competency interview which consists of some screening questions, like checking your right to work in the UK (unfortunately we can’t sponsor visas), and your experience in our hiring competencies.

This first interview has two purposes: it's a chance for you to ask questions about how we work, and for us to find out what you're looking for from your next role.

We'll also be interested to find out more about your curiosity, initiative, technical, communication and teamwork skills. So we'll be interested to talk about things like: your approach to dealing with difficult situations like dealing with conflicting or ambiguous requirements, how you communicate your work with others and how you learn new things and teach others.

The final stage interview consists of a half-day of interviews, where you’ll do a conversational technical interview and a pairing session with one of our engineers. You don’t need to prepare anything & there’s no take-home portion of the interview process.

How we assess candidates
We use a set of competencies to evaluate candidates throughout the interview process: communication, initiative, teamwork, curiosity and technical skill. You can read more about these in our blog post about our hiring framework.

RECRUITMENT PROCESS
Please contact jobs@futurelearn.com if you require any reasonable adjustments or alterations to be made, to support you through the recruitment process.

You’ll have the opportunity to work with big data technologies, building scalable and reliable solutions to support real-time analytics, advanced data science and critical operational projects powered by data.

What We Do

The Data Systems team’s role is to build a transformational data platform in order to democratise data in Just Eat. Our team is built on following ideals:

Open Data: We ingest all data produced across Just Eat using batch and realtime pipelines and make it available to every employee in Just Eat. This data is then used to drive analytics, business intelligence, data science and critical business operations.

Self Service: We build tools, frameworks and processes to support self-service modelling and activation of data. Our goal is to empower our users to find, process and consume our data without barriers.

Single Truth: We build services that host all metadata about Just Eat’s data in a single store and promote governance, data culture and Single Source of Truth.

Intelligent Personalisation: We build and maintain a machine learning platform which supports data scientists in developing and deploying ML models at production scale. This allows us to deliver insights, personalisation and predictions to our customers at scale.

How We Do It

Our team is built on the following tenets:

Innovate: We are always learning, growing, inquisitive and keen on new technologies and open source tooling. We love like-minded engineers with a passion to keep our code-base and infrastructure best in class.

Collaboration & Ownership: All code is owned by the team and we have multiple avenues for collaboration - rotation, pairing and technical showcases. We also encourage team members to own their own code and promote self-governance.

We’re looking for an enthusiastic engineer to join the Self Service Tools Team within Data Systems.

Self Service Tools

Our mission is to enable all employees to be self-sufficient with data, so that data-driven decisions can be made quickly and easily. We build and maintain all of Just Eat’s data centric tools.

We use engineering to simplify tasks, reducing the technical barrier of entry to navigate, explore and consume our data. Our tools use Airflow to unlock the tasks of transformation and egress of data, making these simple functions that can be undertaken by anyone.

We support over 200 active users across the business, building Airflow backed tools that run thousands of DAGs in multiple timezones. We manage and run our own Airflow clusters on Kubernetes. We work together as a team in three countries to produce innovative products and keep data flowing.

Required skills and experience

Data Engineer,-1,"About graze

graze started in 2008 as a healthy snack subscription service, delivering customised boxes of snacks directly to customers through the post. At the time, there were very few platforms to help us with such a novel idea, so we built our own: from factory machines and systems, to a subscription website and data warehouse.

Ever since those early start-up days, technology and data have always been important in driving our success. Our ability to rapidly develop and iterate tech solutions has been a vital ingredient of our launches into eCommerce and retail, helping us to establish ourselves one of the UK's healthiest snack brands!

In 2019 we were acquired by Unilever, and we're now expanding into Europe. We've already launched graze into Ireland and the Netherlands - and that's just the beginning...

The role, Data Engineer...

Were looking for a Data Engineer to provide technical leadership in our Data team. You will be responsible for managing our data warehouse platform, building and maintaining data pipelines, and designing and delivering technical solutions to business problems.

Our tech stack...

Our AWS Redshift data warehouse is populated by a custom-built batch job scheduling system, which orchestrates hundreds of ETL processes per day. The wealth of data that comes from a vertically-integrated and multi-market consumer goods business means that our pipelines are really diverse... we have processors that deal with anything from ingesting subscription website session data, to retailer sales data, to product weight data from the production lines in our factory!

Our data platform is primarily written in PHP, deployed on Docker on AWS ECS, and we rely on other AWS services like S3, RDS and SQS. Business users can download and upload data via self-serve tools in our internal web application, as well as Tableau dashboards.

Its now been 10 years since graze made our first data hire. A lot has changed in this time, and were always looking for ways to further improve our data systems. Which parts of our system continue to drive real value to the business - how can we make these better? What new tools are out there that were not yet using? Should we migrate our customer-built batch job scheduling to Airflow? We are looking for someone who is excited to get involved in answering these big questions and defining the technical direction that we move in!

What we are looking for in you
Youre curious! You have an ability to quickly learn and adapt, with fast problem-solving capabilities
You have experience in building and maintaining data platforms and pipelines
You love to write clean, efficient, maintainable, version-controlled and well-documented code
You have excellent SQL skills
You enjoy working with end users to build and deploy quality solutions that are valuable to them and the business
What we expect in the first 6 months

Gain enough familiarity with the existing codebase that you can comfortably make and review significant changes.
Be instrumental in scoping and specifying changes to the systems.
Be able to identify areas of improvement and progress changes.
Be able to respond to, triage and fix most operational issues.
Build strong relationships with your team and key people you work with.
Whats in it for you?
A competitive salary, BUPA private medical insurance and pension scheme
25 days holiday + 1 health day + 1 volunteering day, per year
Flexible working - throughout 2020, weve all been working from home. We will continue to offer flexible working in future, allowing for a balance between office and remote working days.

We encourage active learning with learning lunches, networking events or more formal qualifications
Opportunities for presenting on technical subjects, in learning and conference-style environments both internally and externally
Plenty of free snacks!
Were all about inclusivity and making you feel like you belong. We are passionate about having an excellent culture with strong meaningful values so the biggest ask we have is for you to be your authentic self every day whilst doing a great job.

We are launching many new cities to bring Citymapper to users everywhere.

We provide essential information for millions of users, letting them know when the next bus is arriving, which trains are disrupted, and what time they should leave to get home. We need engineers to help build and maintain the systems that do that.

Good transport data, especially realtime information, is why our users love our app.

What you’ll do
Add and maintain sources of realtime departure information in new and existing cities. Lots of feeds and cities require non-trivial and unique strategies in order to reliably show the correct departure times to the user. ""When does my bus arrive?""

Integrate private transport operators into our data streams. Public transport is being complemented by private transport operators in most of the cities we cover - bikes, moped, scooters, cars, etc... ""Where's the nearest electric bike to rent?""
Improve the monitoring and operational systems necessary to keep these 100s of realtime data feeds working. ""Why are we not showing trains in Lyon?""

So what am I responsible for as DevOps Software Engineer?

This is a new role for the Business Intelligence team so you will have the opportunity work with our Web Development and Data Leads to establish the DevOps patterns and principles of the team in line with the Group’s methodologies.

Data Engineer,-1,"The OVO Group's purpose is to drive progress towards net zero carbon living. To reach Plan Zero, we need everyone to come together - not just as customers buying energy, but as members with a common goal. As part of this ambitious plan, our goal is to become the 'Best Employer in the UK' by 2030. If you think you could be the talent we're looking for, then come and join the adventure!

We launched in 2009 with a mission to change energy for the better. Since then, we've welcomed over a million members, planted a million trees, and set our sights on helping save the planet.

As a Group, we're working to become a net zero carbon business by 2030, while helping our OVO Energy members halve their carbon footprints at the same time.

Green energy and technology are great tools to fight the climate crisis with. But it's people power that will rewrite history.

So we're building a zero carbon team inside and out. Of people who share our values, feel inspired by our mission, and want to make change happen. When you work for OVO, it's not just a job. It's the work of a lifetime. And we want the sharpest minds to help.

Up for the challenge?

Where in the world of OVO will I be working?

Following OVO's acquisition of the SSE Retail Energy company earlier this year, the two companies are working hard to integrate their operations. Essential to this is the integration and rationalisation of their technical systems and data processing.

As a Software Engineer you will work closely with OVO and SSE Product, Tech, Data and Analytics, and Data Platform teams. You will be tasked with identifying the right SSE datasources, mapping these into OVO's data model and then implementing solutions using streaming technologies to transform and publish data onto OVO's Data Platform for use by downstream operational and analytical teams.

This role is fundamental to realising solutions that deliver the successful integration of the two organisations, in line with OVO's Data Strategy.

For more information on some of the technical challenges with integrating OVO and SSE's data platforms why not read the excellent blog post written by Katie Russell entitled Eating the Data Elephant.

What will I be doing?
Designing and Implementing solutions that extract high volumes of data from a wide variety of source systems and making it available on OVO's streaming data platform.
Working with technologies including Kafka and Kafka Connect to stream data into Kafka as well as Scala, Kafka Streams, KSQL and microservice architectures to process and transform data streams.
You will form part of an Agile development team responsible for delivering high quality solutions iteratively into OVO's production systems using XP and CI/CD best practices.
Helping to ensure good engineering practices are adopted and used within the team.
Working closely with stakeholders to understand the various source systems including details of their interfaces, data models and capabilities in order to design appropriate solutions to extract and transform the data.
Assisting in the evaluation of appropriate tools and technologies that will shape the design of the SSE / OVO data migration and integration strategy.
Is this the job for me?
Experience designing and building large-scale streaming data pipelines that utilize streaming technologies (e.g. Kafka Streams, Amazon Kinesis or similar) with an emphasis on the sourcing and transformation of data is essential.
You are a software engineer with an interest in the data domain (data modelling, data transformation, etc.).
You are comfortable working in an agile development environment that employs continuous integration and continuous delivery best practices, and have experience of pair programming, BDD/TDD, CI/CD and deployment strategies.
You are a strong advocate for engineering best practices including unit testing, integration testing, static code analysis and code reviews.
You are motivated by fast-paced environments where teams have high degrees of autonomy.
Experience with Scala would be an advantage but if you have an appetite to learn new technologies and a drive for continual improvement we'd love to talk to you.
From us you'll get*
4% of your salary to spend on flexible lifestyle benefits
5% matched employer contribution to your pension
25 days holiday + 1 for your birthday
An annual discretionary bonus
And many more...

(*) Please note that certain benefits kick-in once you have passed probation which can be up to 6 months after your start date.

We want the best people

At OVO, we empower our people to have choice around where and when they work - flexible working arrangements can be discussed for all of our roles. Please speak to the Talent Acquisition team for more info.

You will need to have or be eligible for the appropriate security clearances. This is a contract role outside of IR35. Initial expected deliverables are estimated to take 6 months to deliver.

We are looking for a Data Alchemist to join our client, an exciting and fast-growing startup who already have some great contracts in place, on a contract or permanent basis.

This is a brilliant opportunity to join a team of individuals who are dedicated and passionate about what they do. Embracing VR and modern tech. Big data,and they're after you!

The foundation to their success is the incredible value they unlock for their customers. They iterate fast, always work directly with the end user and build an intimate understanding of their customers' risks and requirements. That’s where you come in. You will be working right at the coal face, and become an essential member of the team. As a Data Alchemist you will enable their customers to make gold from lead.

The work is deeply technical and always changing. You will be using, customising and extending their products, integrating the best of open source and helping every customer solve their unique problems in a unique fashion.

You will do this while learning general lessons and developing and prototyping products that make them even better value for the next customer!

They are a fully remote organisation but their most important work happens face to face with their customers. You will represent them to the customer and as a valued member of the team you will be their advocate, guiding leadership and the off-site devs in what the customers need.

Strong project management and organizational skills.
Experience supporting and working with cross-functional teams in a dynamic environment.
Desirable Criteria
Experience with AWS (what we use) or other cloud based platforms, with a desire to learn AWS.

Interested?

We operate like a startup, so being self-motivated, curious, and flexible is a good start. You prefer to come up with your own solutions to problems but are not afraid to ask for help.

Our technology makes it simple to create, combine, and extend large-scale, high-performance intelligent systems in ways that were never before possible.

Broadway’s solutions are built on the TOC, our core platform for scalable high-performance distributed computing. For over a decade, we’ve been using the TOC to build intelligent trading systems for leading financial institutions. We’re now starting to leverage the same technology to solve real-time problems across every industry.

Culture
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.

Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.

Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.

Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.

Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.

Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

Senior Software Engineer,-1,"Description

CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: Hiring at Made Tech continues as usual. Our team are now all working remotely so all interviews will be facilitated remotely too. Hopefully this will still be a good experience for candidates. (feedback welcome)
We're even setup to on-board any new starters remotely should we need to. All our projects are setup to continue remotely as well :)

---------------------------

NOTE: We currently have no open roles at this level for Manchester at this time. We review our requirements frequently and would encourage you to register your interest for this role. You will receive a response from and we'll keep you posted on upcoming live roles at this level :)

Salary range is £45,900 - £63,000 per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.

Our Senior Software Engineers are senior contributors to digital, data and technology outcomes that improve society. They do this by delivering and architecting software, and coaching others to do so in public sector organisations, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Senior Software Engineers find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.

High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.

We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.

We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. Right tool for the job.

For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!

We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Software Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.

Requirements

While we will look for you to have experience in these things, if you don’t have one of these don’t let that stop you applying.

Our mission? To enable the most realistic and effective military simulations ever experienced, making defence users more effective on operations and decreasing the cost of military preparedness.


Your Mission
...is to build scientific models that support our entire product offering and facilitate next generation decision support. We are a friendly, relaxed & inclusive team with an ambition to take agent-based modelling to the next level. Unlike many teams, we are a mix of applied scientists and software engineers working very collaboratively both internally and with our Defence customers.

We build software models of social systems as goal-oriented actors operating on imperfect information, “digitally twin” physical environments and infrastructure, and obsess with modularity to recast complex systems as combinations of simpler systems. Our applied scientists seek to balance cutting-edge research with pragmatism and creativity when designing new models. We touch on a range of interesting topics such as probabilistic programming and reinforcement learning to name just two.
Your Impact
You will work broadly; conceptualising a system and writing a design document, building software to convert that into a prototype model (we are language agnostic, and usually work in Python and C++) and you will help educate others on your approach.
Your role will combine literature reviews, conceptual modelling & software engineering to create scientifically defensible models that underpin our product offering
Building software pipelines to extract and integrate data from various sources, making it available to simulation engines and user interfaces.
You will be building socio-technical models of real-world phenomena that allow our customers to better understand how individuals interact with physical, political, information and other systems.
Your work will help military tacticians understand situations and plan more effectively, ultimately helping add to the stability and security of the world.
If you identify with the following, we'd love to chat:
You are an experienced software engineer with fluency in at least one relevant OO or functional programming language and the openness to learn and adapt to a variety of languages. We currently use Python and C++ a lot as well as many of the related tools and libraries.
You support and have a clear appreciation of the modern software engineering workflow & delivery mechanisms.
You are enthusiastic about continuously improving and rapidly developing new competencies.
You are able to effectively communicate with clients in person, in writing and with visualisation.
You have an interest in machine learning engineering (e.g. agent-based modelling, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, bayesian networks, probabilistic programming, machine learning).

While we think the above experience could be important, we’re keen to hear from people that believe they have valuable experience to bring to the role.

The world is changing.
We all want something different.
At Luno, we see you as individuals.

Together, we are upgrading the world of work to unleash the potential within and empower you to become the best possible version of yourself.

Upgrading the entire planet to a new financial system is a challenge of epic proportions. Like the first moon landing, it requires a special kind of people working together with unusual skill, focus and determination. We're changing the financial landscape, and to do so, well we need the best team on board for our mission. In short, to achieve our goals, we need rockstars. As simple as that.

A little about us:
We make it safe and easy to buy, store and learn about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
We currently have over 5 million customers across 40 countries.
We're part of the Digital Currency Group, a group of companies driving progress in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space that includes Grayscale, Genesis, Coindesk and Foundry Services.
Our platform has processed over $14 billion to date.
We're proud to be one of the world's most international cryptocurrency teams from 43 different nationalities — working across South Africa, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.

How we work


Our engineering team (currently ~100 engineers) is split into organisations which we call Fleets. Each Fleet focuses on a core customer journey (onboarding, security, payments, support, new business, growth and marketing etc.). Each of these fleets contains multiple smaller teams called Pods, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of the product.

Pods will include a product owner, product designer, back-end engineers, Android, iOS and Web developers, who each bring a unique perspective to the problem you are all contributing towards.

We're agile, use scrum, continuous integration and continuous delivery, deploying to production every single day.

We're building teams to help us succeed in our mission to upgrade the world to a better financial system. You'll be joining a group of highly motivated software engineers who you'll work collaboratively with across our pods.

As a fast-growing company with offices around the world, you'll immediately see how your contributions directly impact both our internal users and client experience. Many of the problems we are solving result in trail blazing solutions which can't be found on Stack Overflow; so we're looking for engineers who flourish working in a complex domain.

In your first six months, you will:


...start at Luno by learning our processes, meeting the wider team and starting our engineering on-boarding program. After getting comfortable with the basics, you'll start learning our idiomatic patterns in a safe, easy-to-follow way - by building your own toy micro services. You'll get to practice how we do design docs, code reviews, deployments, events, logging and monitoring.

You'll meet the Pod(s) you'll be working with and quickly align on the teams' current OKRs and product roadmap. We succeed as a team, so we will provide you with regular feedback from your manager and peers and will encourage you to do the same.

Your mission will involve:
Build distributed microservices that are accessed by 2.5m customers from across the globe.
Design, build and maintain advanced applications services.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features.
Write testable, maintainable code for robustness and reliability.
Work on bug fixing and improving application performance.
Write code that directly affects users, the company and the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The ideal candidate for this role will have:
A passion for blockchain and cryptocurrencies (this is a new industry so we'll help you learn about how the blockchain works and the technicals).
A proven background in computer science in areas such as algorithms, data structures, and software design.
Extensive programming experience in at least one language such as Go, Java, C++, C#, Python, etc.
A continuous improvement mindset.
BSc/MSc/PhD in computer science or other technical discipline, or equivalent working experience
A passion for software development, mobile technology and Bitcoin
To be friendly, transparent, articulate and driven to succeed
A work permit for the UK if you are not a British citizen
Don't be put off if you don't tick all of the boxes – they're a guide based on what we'd love to see but we appreciate that excellent software engineers have diverse backgrounds.

Remote Life at Luno


If you're looking to work on something truly global and disruptive with a forward-thinking and ambitious team that highly values diversity, teamwork, and the continuous quest for excellence, then this is an opportunity for you.

Like the majority of the companies, Luno is currently working remotely to keep our employees safe, which means you will not be physically, but virtually onboarded for now!
Live long and prosper. We've got you covered with excellent private medical insurance.
Generous maternity / paternity and even (yes, you are reading it correctly) paw-ternity for your furry friend..

We are a social bunch of people, we have virtual quarterly activities and drinks Fridays for whoever wants to join!
We have virtual cooking, dancing, drawing and house planting classes hosted by our Lunauts Monthly to break up your day and work that other part of your brain.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

---------------------------

NOTE: We currently have no open roles at this level for Manchester at this time. We review our requirements frequently and would encourage you to register your interest for this role. You will receive a response from and we'll keep you posted on upcoming live roles at this level :)

Salary range is £45,900 - £63,000 per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.

Our Senior Software Engineers are senior contributors to digital, data and technology outcomes that improve society. They do this by delivering and architecting software, and coaching others to do so in public sector organisations, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Senior Software Engineers find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.

High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.

We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.

We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. Right tool for the job.

For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!

We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Software Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.

We need flexible individuals who enjoy a varied workload, are happy to switch between being more and less hands-on, but don't see themselves stepping away from code any time soon.

Node, Typescript, Koa, GraphQL React, React Native, Webpack, Babel
CircleCI, Kubernetes, Docker and Google Cloud Platform
Ideally, you would be familiar with these technologies or similar patterns; notably, Typescript/Javascript coupled with React is a core technology for us. But we’re more interested in your broad experience of software development than of specific tools or libraries. You should be comfortable getting up-to-speed quickly in new tools and platforms. You should be pragmatic and experienced enough to know when a different choice of technology would be more suitable, and comfortable leading explorations into new technologies.

"Software Engineer (Model Engineering), Defence",-1,"Improbable has created SpatialOS: a networking solution combining low latency, tools for faster iteration, and a ready-to-go architecture capable of supporting innovative games.

Now the Improbable Defence division, building on the backbone of SpatialOS, has combined world class scientific modelling, market leading AI, mission specific user interfaces and a uniquely flexible and secure deployment model to create a powerful simulation platform tailored to the needs of the military.

Our mission? To enable the most realistic and effective military simulations ever experienced, making defence users more effective on operations and decreasing the cost of military preparedness.


Your Mission
...is to build scientific models that support our entire product offering and facilitate next generation decision support. We are a friendly, relaxed & inclusive team with an ambition to take agent-based modelling to the next level. Unlike many teams, we are a mix of applied scientists and software engineers working very collaboratively both internally and with our Defence customers.

We build software models of social systems as goal-oriented actors operating on imperfect information, “digitally twin” physical environments and infrastructure, and obsess with modularity to recast complex systems as combinations of simpler systems. Our applied scientists seek to balance cutting-edge research with pragmatism and creativity when designing new models. We touch on a range of interesting topics such as probabilistic programming and reinforcement learning to name just two.
Your Impact
You will work broadly; conceptualising a system and writing a design document, building software to convert that into a prototype model (we are language agnostic, and usually work in Python and C++) and you will help educate others on your approach.
Your role will combine literature reviews, conceptual modelling & software engineering to create scientifically defensible models that underpin our product offering
Building software pipelines to extract and integrate data from various sources, making it available to simulation engines and user interfaces.
You will be building socio-technical models of real-world phenomena that allow our customers to better understand how individuals interact with physical, political, information and other systems.
Your work will help military tacticians understand situations and plan more effectively, ultimately helping add to the stability and security of the world.
If you identify with the following, we'd love to chat:
You are an experienced software engineer with fluency in at least one relevant OO or functional programming language and the openness to learn and adapt to a variety of languages. We currently use Python and C++ a lot as well as many of the related tools and libraries.
You support and have a clear appreciation of the modern software engineering workflow & delivery mechanisms.
You are enthusiastic about continuously improving and rapidly developing new competencies.
You are able to effectively communicate with clients in person, in writing and with visualisation.
You have an interest in machine learning engineering (e.g. agent-based modelling, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, bayesian networks, probabilistic programming, machine learning).

While we think the above experience could be important, we’re keen to hear from people that believe they have valuable experience to bring to the role.

Equal Opportunity
The best ideas are often the least expected and require new ways of thinking; that’s why our teams at Improbable are made up of an incredible range of talented people. Improbable is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Engineering and Product based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

A bit more about us


We’re a diverse group of people. With backgrounds ranging from data science to music production, more than 80% of our team come from outside the world of finance – providing us with a unique perspective as we help consumers feel more in control of their lives. For us, an interest in people comes first; finance follows.

More about what we're doing


The APIs and infrastructure we’re building are designed to place the power of personal data back into the hands of normal people. Picture this: a world where your bank knew you were paying too much for your gas bill and could switch you to a more suitable provider, or understood your savings targets and could automatically find you a better deal. That’s what we’re working towards.

We believe that diversity will make us better


Bud’s mission is to create the world’s most compelling financial data products. Getting there requires a workforce as diverse as the people we create our products for, be that in terms of age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, or ways of thinking. We truly believe that these differences will make us grow as a company and a team. We strive to create a workplace and culture where our people are empowered, supported, given equal opportunities and can bring their authentic selves to work.

Data Platform Engineer - GCP/AWS,-1,"Location
Whilst you may have any of our UK offices as a base location, you must be fully flexible in terms of assignment location, as these roles may involve periods of time away from home during the week at short notice.
An overview of the role
Do you want to make a real difference in your career, a difference that affects people’s lives and transforms the way companies and government operate? Do you want to amaze people, to take them on a journey and show them something truly fantastic? Do you want to be at the forefront of the AI revolution?
The role
Collaboration/Innovation
The Data Engineering, Architecture and Platform practice is part of Capgemini’s global Insights & Data group; our goal is to help the organisations we work with become truly ‘insight driven’, to fully exploit their data using the convergence of Cloud and Artificial Intelligence to deliver real business value. We marry the most innovative insights solutions with rock solid, industrialised engineering.
The work
We can’t become ‘insight driven’ without data. We can’t deliver the AI revolution without data. Data is the lifeblood of everything we do in Insights and Data. We embrace experimentation and industrialisation, so we need passionate, energetic data engineers who are focussed on using their skills to drive out real business value from their data assets.
Now the data space is clearly very large, thus the myriad of skills and technologies is equally sized but also rapidly evolving. So it’s important to us that you have a desire for continued learning. We want you to be thinking “how can I use what I know?”, “what do I need to learn?” in order to help your client achieve their business goals.
Why You?
We don’t really have a typical day or typical project at Capgemini. Our clients expect advice, proof-of-values, industrialised solutions; we work on small and very large engagements and we work across several different sectors, including public, CPG, retail, manufacturing and utilities. If you aren’t on a project, you could instead be involved in a bid, doing some training, working on a point-of-view, building a demo or contributing to our blog series (tips from recent new joiners, who we are happy for you to speak with, is just ‘get stuck in’). In recent months, we’ve done some pretty cool stuff, like used Tensor Flow in a model looking at acoustics of voice recordings, used ESA radar data to classify UK vegetation and massive scale Spark for image processing at an O&G client.

We are looking to bring in people at all levels from fledgling Engineers to seasoned Architects, so whilst the list of skills below is fairly heavy, please do get in touch even if you only have two or three.

Google Cloud Platform
IBM Cloud

Experience of developing enterprise grade ETL/data pipelines with tools
Software engineering practices (coding practices to DS, unit testing, version control, code review)
Hadoop (especially the Cloudera and Hortonworks distributions), other NoSQL (especially Neo4j and Elastic), and streaming technologies (especially Spark Streaming)
Deep understanding of data manipulation/wrangling techniques
Experience using development and deployment technologies, for instance virtualisation and management (e.g. Vagrant, Virtualbox), continuous integration tools (e.g. Jenkins, Concourse, Drone, Bamboo), configuration management tooling (e.g. Ansible) and containerisation technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm)
Experience building and deploying solutions to Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) including Cloud provisioning tools (e.g. Terraform)
Strong interpersonal skills with the ability to work with clients to establish requirements in non-technical language.
Ability to translate business requirements into plausible technical solutions for articulation to other development staff.
Experience designing analytics deliveries, planning projects and/or leading teams
Why Us?
While we’re a global consultancy, we’re made up of supportive, close-knit communities. Everyone wants to get the best solutions for our customers and create the best working environment.

Upskilling
Potential is just as important to us as having the required skills. If you have the right mindset, we might be able to provide you with bespoke training. So if you’re not sure you have all the skills you need, but you’re still passionate about the role, please apply and we’ll see if we can support you.

Diversity
Capgemini positively encourages applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or belief, marital status, or pregnancy and maternity. We are committed to hiring, developing and retaining the best people to deliver innovative, world-class solutions for our clients.

As one of the world’s leading engineering, professional services and technical consultancy firms, at WSP, we’re passionate about the big questions. And big answers, naturally. For us that’s all about reaching beyond the expected to do work that’ll make a profound impact felt long into the future.

The world is changing around us - the actual physical world is becoming increasingly bound up with the digital, as we learn to model reality; as objects become part of the Internet of Things; as vehicles and infrastructure become autonomous; and as cities and their buildings become 'smart'. Here at WSP we’ve built a successful business by applying our intelligence to the built and natural environments for over a hundred years, earning the hard-won trust of thousands of clients. Now those clients are trusting us to enable them to take advantage of the amazing potential of new digital technologies in order to improve the (real, everyday) lives of millions of (real, everyday) people. This has meant the rapid and ongoing growth of our 'Smart Consulting' division.

The ever-increasing amount of 'Smart Consulting' work, with more challenging requirements, has led us to start building a strong, dedicated team who are focused on delivering a set of flexible, but coherent, projects which will sit on a common Cloud Platform. Though actively expanding into other areas, our in-house development team specialises in Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions, and bespoke cloud developments.

As a Senior/Mid Data Engineer on WSP’s projects you will have a broad and challenging remit - from helping with software architecture design, leading on data design and engineering, assisting with client requirements capture and building cloud-based software that models and has an actual impact on the real world in which we live. The remit is ever changing, and we need individuals who embrace change, and are up for a challenge.

For the Smart Consulting team, culture is a big deal. We look for team members who have a positive view but with realistic expectations.

Senior Software Engineer (Data Science),-1,"A brief update on Covid-19 (coronavirus)

Simply Business is well prepared to deal with unprecedented events. We’re an agile business by nature – and our hiring and interview process is no exception. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some parts of our hiring process may take a little longer than usual. Please bear with us, and rest assured that we're happy to hear from you and receive your application.

If it looks like you could be a good fit for the role, we’ll ask you to interview on Zoom – you’ll need WiFi and a laptop, or a 4G-enabled smartphone.

Technology. Award-winning customer service. Bleeding-edge data ability. Simply Business is a new type of insurance company, using all of the above to create the best possible insurance experience for small businesses and self-employed people. We love working here, and have even taken the number one spot in the Sunday Times Best Company To Work For 2015 and 16 lists; we’ve stopped entering now to focus on a few bigger projects, but you get the idea.

It’s a great place to work.

There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act. So no need to worry about school pick-ups, or a horrible commute.

Our people are our most important asset, so we focus on building a working life that helps us thrive, not stick. We're proud of our inclusive and supportive culture, and we're passionate about creating an environment where everyone's cultural backgrounds, skills, and perspectives are valued. Join us and you’ll be part of our journey to creating something even better, for our customers and ourselves.

The Data Science team is responsible for designing and implementing machine-learning solutions to create advanced insights and automate processes using data. The team is part of the Data and Analytics department, and includes a mix of data scientists and data engineers.

Responsibilities include:
support users of the machine-learning platform
productionise different types of machine-learning solutions
support data scientists throughout the machine-learning lifecycle
investigate state of the art tooling and best practices for MLOps

What are the benefits?

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call ‘core benefits’. On top of that, you can pick and choose from the more exciting options we offer – whether it’s a full gym membership, lifestyle pot, comprehensive private health cover, extra holiday or a National Trust pass.

The ‘core’ stuff
These are available to all staff from your first day. Here’s the summary:

• a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day
• an automatic enrolment pension (employer-matched at 5%)
• generous holiday entitlement
• life assurance – 4 x your basic salary

The fun stuff
We also have a great deal more to pick and mix from, with things like:

• private medical insurance
• extra days annual leave (up to 5 days)
• shopping vouchers
• dental insurance

But there’s so much more to Simply Business than insurance and memberships.

Best of all, though, are the groups, clubs, and adventures that come with the Simply Business territory. Forget a simple Give As You Earn scheme (although we’ve got that too) – we trek the Sahara for charity, take you on weekends away, throw epic summer parties, and meet up for book groups, public speaking coaching, yoga, manicures, beer brewing, and lots, lots more.

Our values

Everything we do comes down to these five values – empowerment, authenticity, simplicity, learning and pioneering. In practice, these will mean something unique to every person at Simply Business, but if you’re considering working here, give them some thought. They’re at the heart of our story.

Empowerment
We're trusted to get the right stuff done in the way that suits us best

Authenticity

Senior Software Engineer (Backend),-1,"At Zoopla we want to help everyone make intelligent home buying decisions. We are building a team that will have the once in a career opportunity to re-imagine our industry.

The interesting stuff…
You will have spent lots of quality time with your IDE of choice, deeply learning the powerful idioms and important idiosyncrasies of multiple programming languages and their ecosystems. We like to code mostly in Golang, Python, Node.js / JavaScript, .NET Core and Perl here, but we’re open to all.
You will ideally know AWS as well as you know your best friend, although it’s great if you’re good friends with other cloud services, too.
You will have diligently practiced your engineering craft, mastering your skills in techniques such as TDD, refactoring, clean code and pair programming.
You will have implemented CI pipelines and automation, championed the quality and deployment benefits of both to others.
The product(s) you’ve built will have delighted users (perhaps millions of them!) while being stable, performant, observable and supportable.
If you’ve played a role in designing and implementing new architectures and technical strategies, while also looking after existing technology real estate, you’ll fit in great.
Importantly, if you’re looking for a senior role with us, you will have achieved many of the things above while also teaching others, influencing your team and organisation, and maybe even sharing your journey and knowledge publicly.
Why Zoopla…
We're serious about tech but we don't take ourselves too seriously.
We are spiritually agile, not religiously agile.
We strongly believe in the value of good design. We believe it is a primary differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
We believe in the value of data. We run a team that is data informed. We think being data-driven is soulless and dangerous. Clean, confident, clear data combined with the insights of the team is what drives our decisions.
We want to build small, collaborative, cross-functional teams that push each other to create elegant, simple solutions to difficult customer problems.
No matter what the role we want everyone to be obsessed with getting inside the minds of our customers.
How do you know we’re the best place for you?
You strive to set the standard and are always looking to raise the bar and want to be surrounded by others who do so as well
You enjoy knowing your customer
You want to build things together, collaboratively with your team
You want to own it; to have ownership and accountability for the outcomes of your effort
You value sharing and committing to discussions and debates with your teammates

Wagestream is the global leader in Earned Wage Access [EWA}. We provide an income streaming solution for employers to give employees instant access to their earnings, and prevent them ever having to go into debt between pay cycles.

We were founded for a social purpose to reduce the poverty premium. We believe the monthly pay cycle is fundamentally broken and unfair to employees, and that we can fix it. We know financial services are better served through the employer, and have built a set of tools [track, stream, save, learn], that boost the financial resilience of a workforce and have a measurable and proven impact on employee retention and productivity.

We love our clients and do everything we can to support them. We already help 350,000 employees access their income when they need it, across some of the largest organisations in the UK including the NHS, Bupa, Holland & Barrett, Stonegate Pubs and Rentokil. In July 2020, Wagestream raised additional funding to expand into new markets in Europe and North America.

Job Description

When an employer signs up for Wagestream, we integrate with their HR and WFM (workforce management) systems so that we know exactly how much employees have worked and earned. Although we've done 100+ of these integrations already, each one is a little bit unique.

You will support the integrations team, working with employers to integrate their systems. Integration usually takes less than 1-2 days but sometimes can take a week or two. This means you will be juggling multiple -- often a dozen or more -- concurrent integrations. The work is actually really fun, because every company uses slightly different terminology, jargon and data models, and the core engineering challenge is figuring out how to adapt and normalize these idiosyncrasies into a common framework.

The technology stack is AWS+Python+Postgres, but experience with those particular technologies is not required. You should however, have a strong command of SQL, and a strong command of cloud-based architectures.

About You:


We'd love to talk with you if you:
Are tenacious in problem solving, both creative and willing to scalpels as well as sledgehammers to get projects over the line.
Do not take no for an answer, and believe there's always a way to work around an obstacle and blocker in a project.
Love getting your hands dirty at the intersection of integrating different systems and making that more efficient.
Are humble and willing to go above and beyond guiding clients IT and software engineers around the best ways to get both our respective systems integrated.
Primary Responsibilities
Collaborate with the IT departments at our enterprise customers
Architect, develop, test, and maintain code to integrate with third-party WFM systems
Contribute to the broader engineering team (best practices, tools, technologies)
Requires limited (1 day per month) travel within the UK
Requirements
3+ years experience in professional software engineering
Mastery of the fundamentals of consuming APIs. REST, XML, yes even SOAP -- you should be comfortable consuming any API
Ideal candidate will have experience in working within AWS. We are heavy users of DynamoDB, SQS, S3, SES, Lambdas, API Gateway, etc
