# Data-Science-Job-Analysis
Collecting and analysing Glassdoor job posting data. Data collection was performed by modifying a prebuilt scraper (credits to https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium) to my use case. Using Selenium it was possible to extract job posting information regarding different data science related job titles in various countries. Jupyter notebook was used for importing and cleaning the data. Exploratory data analysis was then performed to gain insights into job profiles.

Versions used:
- Anaconda 4.8.5
- Python 3.7.9
- Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
- Selenium 3.141.0
