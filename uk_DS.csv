Everybody likes to say they’re different...

Newton was founded to buck the norm in management consultancy - to demand better for its clients. Because, for us, change doesn’t come from behind a laptop.

We’re called upon to bring much-needed change, from redesigning social care to improving build efficiencies on aircraft carriers. The work’s varied and complex - just how we like it. And no one else does it quite like we do. Take our business model. We guarantee our fees against delivering results, and will only leave once our clients see those results stick. Bold - yes. Disruptive? Always.

Blindingly fast career progression means that if you show you’re ready to step up - you’ll be promoted. Because we recognise talent, not tenure. And with all the support, training, and development you need, there’s really no stopping you. No matter the role you join in, you’ll be surrounded by spirited, naturally curious people. People who want to learn from you, and who’ll also teach you a thing or two along the way. It’s how everyone goes further, faster.

Please bear with us, and rest assured that we're happy to hear from you and receive your application.

We love working here, and have even taken the number one spot in the Sunday Times Best Company To Work For 2015 and 16 lists; we’ve stopped entering now to focus on a few bigger projects, but you get the idea.

It’s a great place to work.

There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act.

discover data insights and share findings with the rest of the business
engage with technology and business teams to explain and illustrate data science concepts
Responsibilities include:
proactively proposing opportunities and ideas to apply data science in the business
communicating complex technical concepts to both tech and non-tech people
keeping up to date with the latest trends in data science
What we’re looking for:
at least two years experience as data scientist
demonstrable hands on experience with statistical data analysis and feature extraction
demonstrable experience designing, building, testing and maintaining ML models to solve business problems
proficient programming skills using Python libraries for data science
proficiency with data visualization and business storytelling
proficiency with SQL and data wrangling
strong presentation and communication skills
experience working with non-technical stakeholders
What are the benefits?

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call ‘core benefits’. On top of that, you can pick and choose from the more exciting options we offer – whether it’s a full gym membership, lifestyle pot, comprehensive private health cover, extra holiday or a National Trust pass.

The ‘core’ stuff
These are available to all staff from your first day. Here’s the summary:

• a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day
• an automatic enrolment pension (employer-matched at 5%)

• private medical insurance
• extra days annual leave (up to 5 days)
• shopping vouchers

Best of all, though, are the groups, clubs, and adventures that come with the Simply Business territory. Forget a simple Give As You Earn scheme (although we’ve got that too) – we trek the Sahara for charity, take you on weekends away, throw epic summer parties, and meet up for book groups, public speaking coaching, yoga, manicures, beer brewing, and lots, lots more.

Our values

Brief Description

Salary: £25,198-£29,390 or £31,305-£37,028 (dependent on skills and experience and inclusive of annual role-based allowance)
Grade: Band C/D
Contract Type: Open-Ended
Hours: Full Time
Closing Date: 8th November 2020

STFC’s Accelerator Science and Technology Centre (ASTeC) undertakes particle accelerator research for current and future ‘Big Science’ facilities. We work on numerous high-profile projects with other STFC departments, national partners such as Diamond, and with international labs such as CERN, DESY and PSI. ASTeC has experience in designing, commissioning and operating particle accelerators, with a focal point for these efforts being a dedicated accelerator test facility – CLARA, hosted at Daresbury Laboratory. CLARA is being built in stages to test concepts particularly relevant for novel acceleration and Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) – providing a platform for underpinning R&D for a future UK X-ray FEL, while being broadly relevant for a variety of projects. ASTeC is a key partner within the world leading Cockcroft Institute (CI). We work closely together on a broad range of accelerator research topics and have a number of joint PhD studentships with CI university partners.

Accelerator facilities are major investments in research infrastructure, used to investigate many of society’s most pressing problems, so it is vital that they be utilised as effectively as possible. A key ambition for the next generation of facilities is to harness the vast amounts of data available in order to deliver rapid optimisation and control. Obtaining the ultimate accelerator performance will require a research and development programme incorporating online and offline data with advanced control methods such as non-linear optimisation algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Many of these techniques are still in their infancy and so we are planning to expand in this area. Therefore, many opportunities exist for a well-motivated candidate to work with the team of scientists, engineers and academic collaborators in developing new computational and data science systems whilst also helping to build the next generation of world-class ‘Big Science’ particle accelerators.

The role is to be ASTeC’s machine learning specialist, working to develop and implement machine learning techniques for particle accelerators. We are therefore looking for a person with machine learning training/experience who is excited by the challenge of applying their expertise in this area. We welcome applicants at both first degree level and PhD level, with recruitment to either Band C/D respectively. The ideal candidate shares our passion for applying programming and problem solving to science and technology. The role will sit within the Magnetics and Radiations Sources group, with strong connections to the Accelerator Physics group in particular but with broad connections with the various machine learning interests throughout the department. There will also be connections to the SciML expert group within the Scientific Computing Department and national and international networks, including specialist machine learning training opportunities. The successful candidate would in turn be expected to help disseminate best practices within ASTeC. The CI education and training programme targeted at post graduate level covers all aspects of particle accelerators.

Key duties will include the application of machine learning techniques to both online and offline systems. Machine learning techniques will be incorporated into advanced accelerator controls software to optimize performance during operation. Offline studies with datasets generated from the machine or simulations will underpin the online applications. Key techniques are anticipated to include data classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and image recognition.
You will have a strong background in a quantitative field (physics, maths, computer science, statistics, or similar) with good programming skills. You should have a solid understanding of the skills & techniques needed to work with modelling physics systems and experience with machine learning and data science techniques.

A word from us


Everybody likes to say they’re different...

Newton was founded to buck the norm in management consultancy - to demand better for its clients. Because, for us, change doesn’t come from behind a laptop. It comes from getting under the skin of an organisation and learning first-hand how it ticks. It’s not about producing reports that gather dust on a boardroom’s top shelf; it’s about delivering results that actually work.We crack some of the biggest challenges that businesses and public sector organisations face.

We’re called upon to bring much-needed change, from redesigning social care to improving build efficiencies on aircraft carriers. The work’s varied and complex - just how we like it. And no one else does it quite like we do. Take our business model. We guarantee our fees against delivering results, and will only leave once our clients see those results stick. Bold - yes. Disruptive? Always.

Blindingly fast career progression means that if you show you’re ready to step up - you’ll be promoted. Because we recognise talent, not tenure. And with all the support, training, and development you need, there’s really no stopping you. No matter the role you join in, you’ll be surrounded by spirited, naturally curious people. People who want to learn from you, and who’ll also teach you a thing or two along the way. It’s how everyone goes further, faster.

Data Scientist,-1,"Who are we?

Hi! �� We are Ravelin! We're a fraud detection company using advanced machine learning and network analysis technology to solve big problems. Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.

And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide. Join us and you’ll learn fast about cutting-edge tech and work with some of the brightest and nicest people around - check out our Glassdoor reviews.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.

The Team

You will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low – and clients happy – by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google’s Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.

Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it’s down to the Detection team to investigate why.

The Detection team is core to Ravelin’s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.

The Role

We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.

Evaluating fraud models is hard; often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You’ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you’re investigating the veracity of the model itself.

We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud: our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.

The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job – and understand why both are important.

Responsibilities
Build out our model evaluation and training infrastructure.
Develop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs
Write new features in our production infrastructure
Research new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour
Investigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models).
Requirements
Experience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn).
Strong analytical skills.
Being a strong collaborator with colleagues outside of your immediate team, for example with client support teams or engineering.
Being skilled at communicating complex technical ideas to a range of audiences.
The ability to prioritise and to manage your workload.
Being comfortable working remotely. While we are working towards getting everyone back in to the office, it is likely that the first several weeks of your time at Ravelin will be characterised by you or many of your colleagues working remotely. The ability to be effective in these circumstances will therefore be vital.
Nice to haves
Understand software engineering best practices (version control, unit tests, code reviews, CI/CD) and how they apply to machine learning engineering.
Tensorflow and deep learning experience
Experience with Kubernetes and ML production infrastructure.
Experience with Go, C++, Java or another systems language.
Benefits
Competitive salary & equity package
A minimum of 25 days annual leave + bank holidays
Flexible working hours
Individual learning and development allowance of £1,000/year
Remote volunteer opportunities and monthly company charity donations

Data Scientist,-1,"The opportunity

An exciting opportunity has arisen for a Data Scientist to join the Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge Project ‘Mutographs’ on a Fixed Term Contract until May 2022 (with the possibility of extension). We are looking for a new team member to help us analyse cancer genomes collected from around the world in this ambitious and high profile project.

Mutographs is a large, international, multidisciplinary project, led by Professor Mike Stratton. The project was funded in 2017 in the first round of Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge projects. The project aims to explain major global differences in cancer incidence, through analysis of cancer samples from 5,000 patients, covering 5 different types of cancer, and collected across 5 continents.

We are approximately half way through this project and are looking for someone to join the team to help us analyse cancer DNA sequence data from Work Package 1 by ‘chaperoning’ data through an existing data analysis pipeline. This role is computer-based and full training by existing team members will be provided.

You will work remotely at least for the remainder of 2020 and likely beyond, depending on Government guidelines. You will be welcomed into a team that has been successfully working from home since March 2020, we have experience with on-boarding people remotely and have regular formal and informal meetings to ensure all members of the team continue to feel engaged and motivated in this exciting project. You will work closely with the Mutographs scientists, bioinformaticians and project manager and informally with a wider team from the Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme at the Sanger Institute.

About you

The position would suit a graduate (or equivalent experience) who is interested in genomics and/or cancer biology, wishes to learn or develop their skills in analysing NGS sequencing data and who enjoys responsibility for their own area of work, but within the nurturing environment of a strong team.

We are looking for a team player and effective communicator who works well with others and can also work independently (once trained) to a high level of detail and diligence. Once trained, the successful applicant will be able to manage their own workload and timing, but with structured weekly reporting to the Mutographs scientist and project manager. This is a computer based role and the core work can be repetitive, however there will be opportunity for variation and regular meetings to break up the day/week. The role does not require coding or software development experience as the analytical pipelines are already in place. You will be required to review analysis results via a web interface, interpreting and making decisions based on visual analysis outputs.

Applications from individuals wishing to work part time are welcome (minimum of 20 hours per week, please give an indication of hours in your covering letter).

Interested candidates may contact the Mutographs project manager, Laura Humphreys (lp5@sanger.ac.uk), for further information.

Data Scientist,-1,"Do you have an interest in, and experience of, cryptocurrencies and blockchains and their real-world usage? Do you like coding, as well as exploring, analysing and working with large data sets? If yes, then we want to hear from you.

The impact you will have

This role is a great opportunity for someone who likes to make an immediate impact on a company’s cutting edge products. You will play a key role in supporting Elliptic’s data strategy by continuously building out our data set and the tools to enhance it, remaining in tune with market trends, and ahead of the curve in terms of threat actor behaviour, particularly in the realm of cybercrime. With millions of transactions generated every day, there are endless questions to answer and problems to solve. With access to our own proprietary data, you will be in a unique position to address these.

The role

Data Scientists at Elliptic engage in large-scale data collection efforts, exploratory data analysis, fundamental blockchain research, and make use of a range of techniques spanning across computer science, graph theory, machine learning, and statistics. A significant fraction of our effort is devoted to deciphering and de-anonymising blockchain patterns and anomalies, with particular attention to criminal activity (such as, identifying dark market activity on the blockchain). Data Scientists also write research papers and collaborate with academia (here is an example of what we have been working on).

Your day-to-day will also involve
Conducting independent research to uncover unique patterns of blockchain actors (such as services, dark markets, …); turning these observations first into code, and then into production data for client-facing products
Collaborating with other data scientists and engineers to enhance our existing models, and think creatively about new ones
Staying up-to-date with the latest cryptocurrency research
Maintaining and developing existing Python and Scala codebase
Helping internal teams answer data-specific questions
Who we are

At Elliptic, we believe cryptocurrency will play a huge role in the future of value transfer, and we care deeply about helping to build this future. In order for cryptocurrency to flourish, it’s important to prevent criminal abuse of the technology. Elliptic is the global leader in detecting, preventing, and pursuing criminal activity in cryptocurrencies.

Our customers include the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, financial institutions and government agencies. Our unique platform gives us an unparalleled understanding of cryptocurrency capital flows, using a combination of network science and machine learning to aggregate and interpret vast quantities of transaction data. We provide anti-money laundering (AML) compliance software and investigative services to the leading participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Customers rely on us to analyse more than $150bn of their transactions every month, and include cryptocurrency businesses, major financial institutions, and federal government agencies.

We have offices in London, UK, New York City, Singapore and Tokyo. We are backed by SBI Group, Albion VC, Octopus Ventures, SignalFire, Paladin Capital, Santander InnoVentures, and Digital Currency Group.

Requirements

You will be a good fit here if you
Know the basics of cryptocurrencies and have a genuine interest in understanding what patterns lie beneath the seemingly disorderly structure of the blockchain.
Love coding and appreciates the importance of applying good software engineering practices but at the same time you do not strive for perfect, clean code at the cost of effective research.
Love interrogating data, looking for answers to your questions with an eye for what is most useful for the team and for the company’s objectives.
Know the fundamentals of data science and are able to produce high-quality research while also understanding that training a deep learning model is not always the optimal solution.

Data Scientist,-1,"This multi-disciplinary role broadly supports the aim to transform the way in which economic research and statistics are produced; providing data science supported evidence and data engineering support to projects. At the outset of each project, staff in this role will work from an initial design or concept phase, to successful implementation of proof of concepts, through to delivery of key data sources that can be made accessible across government and wider as well as ‘one-off’ experimental sets of statistics. This involves data interrogation, the coding of functions that conduct statistical or data manipulation tasks, as well as the coding of data processing pipelines. In many cases it will involve linking data either across survey and administrative data and developing longitudinal data for use in research.

The team are developing better economic statistics using new tools and techniques. That primarily includes a new cloud computing platform (DAP), making use of the Spark libraries to process and analyse large datasets (Python and Spark are the main tools that are used in the team) and secondarily supporting smaller projects with local systems built upon Python or R libraries. With this, we can apply data science techniques to produce timelier, more granular and more insightful statistics.

A key aim for staff in this role is to think about how new technology and methods can be applied to the development of economic statistics in the future. Individuals will be able to have the time and space to develop their skills and conduct research, with the aim of getting experimental statistics or analysis out to stakeholders and the wider public sooner.

Responsibilities
• Work with Economic Statistics experts to understand what analysis and research needs to be produced.

• Produce initial design documents and diagrams for data processing systems, considering the statistical or data processing methods that are needed for the task, as well as the design of the overall data model.
• Contribute to Python libraries of statistical or data processing functions, ensuring that any functions are well unit tested.
• Write Python code that will systemize the processing of data, based on initial design documents. This includes writing unit / integration tests and managing versions of code with Git.
• Report on the progress of prototype systems to customers, clearly articulating the impact of various data processing steps on the outputs.
• Maintain and review documentation for statistical and data processing functions, as well as data processing pipelines.
• Manage working relationships with stakeholders across Economic Statistics, keeping people up to date on progress and highlighting any risks with projects.
• Apply agile project management principles to managing projects and tasks on a day-to-day basis.

"Data Scientist, Operations",-1,"We're looking for a curious, adaptable Data Scientist to join the Data & Customer Operations teams at Monzo!

You'll have the chance to analyse all aspects of our customer support operations and help the teams scale how we work to support millions of customers.

We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.

The Data & Customer Operations teams


The data team's mission is to

Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.

For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics. You’ll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.

The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that’s what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.

The role


The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.

A few examples of questions and challenges:
How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?
You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We’re looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.

What’s special about data at Monzo?


Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there’s some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You should apply if:


What we’re doing here at Monzo excites you!
You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues
You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions
You’re comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on

ProFinda
Headquarters: London, UK
https://profinda.com

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

What we are looking for

We're looking for a Data Scientist with 5 or more years of demonstrable experience to work with our Intelligence team on building a semantic, local-grammar based system.

This is a full time role and we would expect the successful candidate to spend at least two days a week in the London Office with the option to work from home on the other days.

As part of your role you will be able to architect and solve complex problems with the best tools you can find. You will research and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms, along with existing libraries usage and will be responsible for new ways of data usage discovery. You will also assist in product development, looking at things from a data perspective and be responsible for key textual data problems, suggestions and deep search.

Skills & Requirements:

· An experience with advanced application architectures (5+ years)

· Experience working with UniTex

· Keen interest in cutting-edge ML/NLP solutions and technologies

· Experience with Ruby, Python or Java will help but we can help you learn these if your experience in another language is good

· Experience with AWS services

· Knowledge of search systems (like Elasticsearch)

· The ability to quickly mockup a solution using one of common ML/NLP libraries (like OpenNLP, Gensim, NLTK and so on)

· An ability to draft a service for subsequent usage by other team members

· Strong Database knowledge (relational, non-relational and graph)

· Familiarity with using REST APIs

· Good writing skills, with a passion for documenting

· Excellent knowledge of English (spoken and written)

· Work in an agile team

· Understand the structure of existing applications and how to work with them

· Interact daily with members of your team and other teams within the broader Engineering team

· Review commits of other team members

Do you want to help the government to try and predict and mitigate the impact of Covid19? Do you want to help aeronautical manufacturers to monitor performance of engines remotely?

What ever your sector or AI application of interest we at Capgemini Insights & Data UK (I&D) are currently working across dozens of clients on some of the most interesting and life transforming AI & Analytics projects. Helping our clients move further than just testing their ideas and concepts and looking to fully exploit their data using the power of AI & Analytics to deliver real business value at scale across the organisation. We don’t really have a typical day or a typical project which means we are kept on our toes and constantly learning. We work on small advisory or proof of value engagements all the way up to very large industrialised solutions across an array of public and private sector clients.

The work

If we believed all the stories about AI, then we’d be looking for budding magicians, wizards and sorcerers; but we don’t. So, whilst the reality is still, quite frankly, fascinating, it is achieved through a lot of ‘smarts’, rather than magic fairy dust. We want passionate, energetic people who live and breathe all things AI, whether that be machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and so on, combined with great software engineering skills…no point creating great models if we can’t deploy them! We want you to be thinking “how can I use what I know?”, “what do I need to learn?”, “how can I build the best relationships with my clients” in order to help achieve their business goals.

Why you?

We are looking to bring in people at all levels. The ideal candidate would have the skills necessary to thrive in a dynamic and fast paced environment but would also want to further both their technical skills and non-technical skills.

Priority skills:

We are looking for enthusiastic candidates with a passion for data science.
We want people who have a track record of delivering value for their clients/ customers.
Experience using Python or R
Knowledge of SQL for accessing and processing data
Capabilities in a range of AI techniques (e.g. supervised and un-supervised machine learning techniques, deep learning, graph data analytics, statistical analysis, time series, geospatial, NLP, sentiment analysis, pattern detection, etc.)
Strong interpersonal and communication skills for both presenting work to clients and disseminating complex information in an easy to understand form on a day to day basis

Things that would really impress us:

Data Science Platforms – Experience using the latest Data Science platforms (e.g. Databricks, Dataiku, AzureML, SageMaker) and frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow, MXNet, scikit-learn)
Software engineering – Good Software engineering practices (unit testing, version control, code review)
Data engineering – Understanding of data manipulation/wrangling techniques
Visualisations – Delivering insights using visualisation tools or libraries (Javascrip, Python, Tableau)
Cloud platforms – Experience building and deploying solutions to Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) including Cloud provisioning tools (e.g. Terraform)
Consulting skills – Ability to translate business requirements into plausible technical solutions for articulation to other development staff.
AI Ethics – Have experience in tools and techniques to ensure the AI model output is fair and stands up to ethical standards
Industry experience – Have extensive experience applying data science to particular industries: healthcare, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, etc…

Why us?

Professional development. Accelerated career progression. An environment that encourages entrepreneurial spirit. It’s all on offer at Capgemini. And although collaboration is at the core of the way we work, we also recognise individual needs with a flexible benefits package you can tailor to suit you.

Why we’re different

At Capgemini, we help organisations across the world become more agile, more competitive and more successful. Smart, tailored, often ground-breaking technical solutions to complex problems are the norm. But so, too, is a culture that’s as collaborative as it is forward thinking.

Who we are

At MADE.COM we believe that everyone should have access to great design. So, we’ve taken a unique approach to making and selling furniture - no middlemen, no agents or importers and no high street stores. Instead we work directly with designers and manufacturers so we can offer high-end furniture at attractive prices.

It’s not an easy task – it takes a creative and dedicated team to make it happen where everyone has an important part to play. We combine our individual passions and skills to create innovative work that’s as exciting and unconventional as the business itself. It’s a place where all ideas are listened to, where brainstorming means job titles get left at the door and where a self-starter can really make their mark.

What you’ll be doing

We are looking for someone who can take and drive the data science capability of the Analytics team. As our Lead Data Scientist, you will be mentoring a team of data scientists and analysts who will be participating in different projects within cross-functional teams. You will be focused on delivery of the business impact through scalable production ready data solutions which can vary from machine learning, data pipelines to advanced visualisation tools.

Technology and innovation are two key factors in our success. Our platform allows us to manufacture in any of over 150 locations, and ship multiple items from one basket seamlessly. Our backend system keeps track of every item of stock, whether it’s in production, on a boat, or at a delivery hub. This allows us to eliminate dormant stock and produce big ticket items as close to on-demand as possible, allowing us to make over 1500 new products this year alone. As a company we seek a competitive edge; as technologists and craftsmen we’re no different. We’ve embraced event-driven architectures, DDD, and CQRS in order to achieve our technical goals. We’re trail-blazers in the Python community, and we contribute back by writing and talking about our findings and open-sourcing our tools.

Analytics team supports multiple streams of the business with some exceptionally successful projects from stock ordering forecasting and optimisation to marketing bidding engine optimisation. And we plan to continue investment into areas that activate the value of DATA. We currently use Google Cloud tools primarily for our internal Data Platform such as BigQuery and Cloud Composer. All our code is executed in the Cloud through DAGs which allows the team to build highly scalable data pipelines and deliver business value efficiently.

Initial areas of responsibility will include:

Data Scientist — Treasury,-1,"We're looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing Treasury Team in London. This role is a unique opportunity to have an impact on TransferWise's mission, grow as a Data Scientist and help save millions more people money.

Your mission:

TransferWise has already pioneered new ways for people to transfer money across borders and currencies. Our customers can also manage their hard-earned money with the world's first platform to offer true multi-currency banking. Your mission is to help run the engine of the company delivering funds to wherever in the world our customers need them as fast as possible. Your team is also entrusted with managing risk from currency rate fluctuations allowing us to offer customers the real mid-market rate.

Here's how you'll be contributing to the Treasury Team
You will help automate treasury operational decisions, dig in piles of data to find golden insights and create production grade models that can be clearly monitored by our operations team.
You will help us manage liquidity and mitigate FX risk in the smartest way, build operational tools and develop strategies.
Your average day will include building new models, maintaining production models, evaluating new ideas, putting out fires etc... (there are no average days)
This role will give you the opportunity to:
Have a direct impact - You will get behind the scene of company transactions, understand where we need to send money and what is the best to do it so our customers get the fast and fair service they deserve. what you build will have an impact on millions of customers.
Work autonomously - we believe people are most empowered when they can act autonomously. So rather than telling you what to do, you'll work with your team to create a vision of your own. Of course, you can always gather feedback from smart, curious people across TransferWise but you'll have the freedom to make your own calls.
Be part of a diverse team - You will work in a team of Data scientists, product managers, engineers and operations across 4 Transferwise offices, a lot of video-calls and some travel is expected.
Be part of our mission to make money without borders the new normal
About you:
You are able to take ownership of a project and see it through from end to end, with past experience in doing so
You are data-driven with a structural and pedantic approach. You are be able to prioritise the value you can add, and manage your time effectively.
You see the bigger picture of business processes and can cut through vagueness to define precisely where and how a model would fit into our stack and what value it would add.
You have a Mathematics/Exact sciences/Engineering/finance background — for example, you're comfortable with deriving variance estimates and re-formulating quadratic optimization problems into forms supported by optimizers
You are familiar with a range of model types, and know when and why to use gradient boosting, neural networks, good old regression, or a blend of these
You have a good understanding of statistics, in particular Bayesian reasoning, and can estimate how accurate your results are, but also know when to stop analysing and deliver results
You are experienced in building machine learning models both on daily time series and on big data (100Ms of rows), using the right tools depending on the data volumes (our team uses Python, SQL, Druid and sometimes Kafka and Spark for shoveling data, but we're open to others ).
You have a solid knowledge of Python, and are able to make and justify design decisions in your Python code; you can throw together a REST service or a UI if need be
You understand fundamental technologies such as Kafka and Docker, and don't think twice about bringing up a new engine in docker-compose to have a play
You are comfortable with visualising and communicating data to various audiences, you easily articulate and present your ideas.
Some extra skills that would be great:
You are familiar with finance, trading or accounting terminology so that it's easier for you to understand, evaluate and explain implications of product decisions in Treasury.
We're people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you're passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you'll fit right in.

Also, qualifications aren't that important to us. If you've got great experience, and you're great at articulating your thinking, we'd like to hear from you.

And because we believe that diverse teams build better products, we'd especially love to hear from you if you're from an under-represented demographic.

We’re a leading energy technology company providing a better experience for our customers through transparency, honesty and simplicity. Better for the planet, through real long-term investment in renewable generation and a low CO2 future. Better value, by throwing away the old business models of the “Big 6” and instead building a business that’s fit for the 21st century. We make energy green and flexible for consumers, with fair and transparent pricing.

You will be working directly with software developers to develop the platform.

As we are a newly-formed team, we are not limited or tied to any process, you can play a big part in shaping the culture.

About the job
Summary
Are you looking for a new challenge?

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the UK’s largest producer of official statistics, covering a range of key economic, social and demographic topics. These include measuring changes in the value of the UK economy, estimating the size, geographic distribution and characteristics of the population, and providing indicators of price inflation, employment, earnings, crime and migration.

Analysis Microdata and Engagement Division is an innovative and collaborative team that produces analysis and research covering all sectors of the economy. Our main customers include teams across the Economic Statistics Group (ESG), but we work closely with colleagues across government and with academia to ensure our analysis and research outputs are relevant for policy and build on work happening outside ONS. Teams in this Division lead on the development of key linked data sources alongside developing new methods for exploiting that data and using it to deliver new insights or to feed into the development of core economic statistics. This is a key role in leading the changes we need to enable this research and support better access to an improved microdata estate. The Data Scientist role covers a range of expertise areas that support the use of new data sources, new processes and new technologies.
Job description
This multi-disciplinary role broadly supports the aim to transform the way in which economic research and statistics are produced; providing data science supported evidence and data engineering support to projects. At the outset of each project, staff in this role will work from an initial design or concept phase, to successful implementation of proof of concepts, through to delivery of key data sources that can be made accessible across government and wider as well as ‘one-off’ experimental sets of statistics. This involves data interrogation, the coding of functions that conduct statistical or data manipulation tasks, as well as the coding of data processing pipelines. In many cases it will involve linking data either across survey and administrative data and developing longitudinal data for use in research.

The team are developing better economic statistics using new tools and techniques. That primarily includes a new cloud computing platform (DAP), making use of the Spark libraries to process and analyse large datasets (Python and Spark are the main tools that are used in the team) and secondarily supporting smaller projects with local systems built upon Python or R libraries. With this, we can apply data science techniques to produce timelier, more granular and more insightful statistics.

A key aim for staff in this role is to think about how new technology and methods can be applied to the development of economic statistics in the future. Individuals will be able to have the time and space to develop their skills and conduct research, with the aim of getting experimental statistics or analysis out to stakeholders and the wider public sooner.

Responsibilities
• Work with Economic Statistics experts to understand what analysis and research needs to be produced.
• Conduct data analysis and visualization of the key datasets used to produce the required outputs
• Produce initial design documents and diagrams for data processing systems, considering the statistical or data processing methods that are needed for the task, as well as the design of the overall data model.
• Contribute to Python libraries of statistical or data processing functions, ensuring that any functions are well unit tested.
• Write Python code that will systemize the processing of data, based on initial design documents. This includes writing unit / integration tests and managing versions of code with Git.
• Report on the progress of prototype systems to customers, clearly articulating the impact of various data processing steps on the outputs.
• Maintain and review documentation for statistical and data processing functions, as well as data processing pipelines.
• Manage working relationships with stakeholders across Economic Statistics, keeping people up to date on progress and highlighting any risks with projects.
• Apply agile project management principles to managing projects and tasks on a day-to-day basis.

Person Specification

Essential Criteria:
• Applied maths, statistics, and scientific practices - Understands, teaches and supervises a wide range of practices, or may have deep expertise on a narrower range of specialisms. Able to apply emerging theory to practical situations.
• Data engineering and manipulation - Has significant experience building data pipelines at scale using a range of tools and technologies and can advise on data engineering best practices across industry. Can lead ad hoc data exploration practices in their business area by identifying and setting best practice and standards. Identifies opportunities for future innovation of data exploration practices.
• Data science innovation - Is a thought leader in their organisation. Identifies future areas of innovation and can show how it can be applied to their organisation and wider government.
• Developing data science capability - Promotes and monitors continuous professional development within their organisation. Develops knowledge of cutting-edge techniques and shares knowledge. Propagates data science capability across the organisation and through external links.

Closing Date: 8th November 2020

STFC’s Accelerator Science and Technology Centre (ASTeC) undertakes particle accelerator research for current and future ‘Big Science’ facilities. We work on numerous high-profile projects with other STFC departments, national partners such as Diamond, and with international labs such as CERN, DESY and PSI. ASTeC has experience in designing, commissioning and operating particle accelerators, with a focal point for these efforts being a dedicated accelerator test facility – CLARA, hosted at Daresbury Laboratory. CLARA is being built in stages to test concepts particularly relevant for novel acceleration and Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) – providing a platform for underpinning R&D for a future UK X-ray FEL, while being broadly relevant for a variety of projects. ASTeC is a key partner within the world leading Cockcroft Institute (CI). We work closely together on a broad range of accelerator research topics and have a number of joint PhD studentships with CI university partners.

Accelerator facilities are major investments in research infrastructure, used to investigate many of society’s most pressing problems, so it is vital that they be utilised as effectively as possible. A key ambition for the next generation of facilities is to harness the vast amounts of data available in order to deliver rapid optimisation and control. Obtaining the ultimate accelerator performance will require a research and development programme incorporating online and offline data with advanced control methods such as non-linear optimisation algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Many of these techniques are still in their infancy and so we are planning to expand in this area. Therefore, many opportunities exist for a well-motivated candidate to work with the team of scientists, engineers and academic collaborators in developing new computational and data science systems whilst also helping to build the next generation of world-class ‘Big Science’ particle accelerators.

The role is to be ASTeC’s machine learning specialist, working to develop and implement machine learning techniques for particle accelerators. We are therefore looking for a person with machine learning training/experience who is excited by the challenge of applying their expertise in this area. We welcome applicants at both first degree level and PhD level, with recruitment to either Band C/D respectively. The ideal candidate shares our passion for applying programming and problem solving to science and technology. The role will sit within the Magnetics and Radiations Sources group, with strong connections to the Accelerator Physics group in particular but with broad connections with the various machine learning interests throughout the department. There will also be connections to the SciML expert group within the Scientific Computing Department and national and international networks, including specialist machine learning training opportunities. The successful candidate would in turn be expected to help disseminate best practices within ASTeC. The CI education and training programme targeted at post graduate level covers all aspects of particle accelerators.
Key duties will include the application of machine learning techniques to both online and offline systems. Machine learning techniques will be incorporated into advanced accelerator controls software to optimize performance during operation. Offline studies with datasets generated from the machine or simulations will underpin the online applications. Key techniques are anticipated to include data classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and image recognition.
You will have a strong background in a quantitative field (physics, maths, computer science, statistics, or similar) with good programming skills. You should have a solid understanding of the skills & techniques needed to work with modelling physics systems and experience with machine learning and data science techniques.

About Cuvva
We’re making insurance radically better. How? By building insurance that’s fair and flexible.

Insurance is completely broken. It’s outdated, complicated, rigid – and we get it, insurance (as you know it) doesn’t sound very exciting. But we’re doing things differently. Using pretty cool technology, we’re making insurance way more fit for the 21st century, building products that actually solve problems.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly car insurance via an app. And we’re also the only insurance provider that provides in-app customer support with an average one minute response time. We’ve sold over 2 million policies and supported over 300,000 customers. We’re a strong, talented team of 80+ and growing.

Why work for Cuvva?
We don’t cut corners. We strive to do the right thing, even when that makes life more difficult for us.

We’ve nurtured an awesome team culture. We always speak up when we have an idea - but also know when to let go and get behind something else.

And we’re comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, and trying new ways of doing things.

We’re building a diverse team from different backgrounds, outlooks and experiences. Everyone is given a fair chance of getting a role at Cuvva. Even if you secretly don’t love insurance, trust us, you’ll love what we’re building.

And if you need any adjustments or support when you’re applying at Cuvva, no worries. Just let us know.
Key Responsibilities

Be part of the team that negotiates pricing of new products and subsequent rate reviews with capacity providers
Proactively review conversion rates and loss ratios and suggest rate reviews

Requirements
4+ years of experience in UK motor insurance market
Strong technical skills - SQL and Python/R experience
Experience building GLMs and machine learning models is a must

Good communication skills are very important - interaction with other teams and insurance companies will be a big part of this role
Self-starter, confident enough to own the whole process from data collection, model build and implementation

About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",4.3,"Cuvva

About the Role
At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

At Deliveroo we’re always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we’re working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.

Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we’re investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We’re looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.

Some of the problems we’re working to solve:

How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments?
How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage?
How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments?
How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects?
How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out?
How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?

Responsibilities:

Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation.
Leveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methods
Prototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstances
Prototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team

Qualifications:

PhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematics
Broad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methods
Familiarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset

Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Engineering and Product based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

This is a UK remote position

Who we are

The current system of credit, based on bureau data, is deeply unfair, penalising people who live in lower income areas, people who are new to the country or customers who have used high risk products in the past (such as payday loans). Koyo was founded in 2018, on the principle that everyone should have access to affordable credit regardless of where they are from, where they live, or types of credit that have used.

Many seeking credit are charged excessive fees and interest rates for borrowing that cause financial problems, rather than solve them. We’re changing all that.

Koyo uses innovative technology to offer fairly priced credit to millions of UK customers. We’re based in London, with global ambitions. Koyo is backed by leading venture capital funds (the same funds that backed the likes of Revolut, Transferwise and others) and some of the most reputable angel investors in the UK. Join us, and help put an end to predatory financial firms and be part of an exciting and rewarding journey.

Our story so far

In 2016, Thomas, the founder of Koyo moved to the UK and found accessing credit to be difficult if not impossible. This is because his credit history did not follow him from his home country. He realised that having an imperfect credit history affects millions of people who are new to the country, but also people who have failed to build a credit history in the UK more generally. In September 2018 we raised our first round of venture funding and have since raised further debt and equity funding from venture capital funds and private investors.

What you'll be doing

You will be our first dedicated data scientist hire.
Improve the accuracy of our in-house banking transaction classification engine - researching, evaluating and recommending the best machine learning algorithms.
Analyse the banking transaction data providing insights and recommendations for summary statistics and quality measures.
Analyse and make recommendations for policies that maximise loan approval rates whilst keeping loan defaults within target using and cross-referencing across all data-sets that are available to us (including but not limited to self-stated application data, credit reference agency block-summary and detailed data and bank transaction data).
Working across the wider team, providing proactive and reactive reporting and analysis.
Longer term, you will help build out the data scientist function at Koyo.

About the Role

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is business impact. You will help answer questions like:

Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How should we improve our consumer, rider, and restaurant apps?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor’s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the food delivery market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How should we make investment decisions company-wide?
How should we decide which rider to assign to a given order?
Which restaurants should we show a given customer?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Qualifications:

Always curious and willing to learn new skills
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact

Data Science at Deliveroo

At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

About the Role

In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation powered by our world class experimentation platform.

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:

Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities

Research Scientist Evidence Synthesis,-1,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research
*There are two Research Scientist openings. We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office; however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.
The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:

Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target
Direct other ""non-billable"" activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).
Serve as consultant to other principal investigators or staff on other systematic review projects.
Act as a guide and mentor to the staff across Evidera locations.
Travel (internationally), as is expected.
Skills and Experience
Demonstrated experience in systematic review (SLR) methods in health economics and/or health services research.
Deep understanding of research principles, relevant methodology and practical research implementation.
Specialist skills in network meta-analysis or epidemiology would be desirable, but are not essential.
Experience with HTA/regulatory submissions, including National Institute for Health and Care. Excellence, SMC, and other European HTA bodies and the European Medicines Agency
Excellent communication skills, including presentations.
Competent in written and spoken English.
Experience in using MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel.

Now you’ve seen our values, it shouldn’t be a surprise that we’re creating a respectful, open, diverse place to work. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues, is not just the right thing to do, it helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
“We are committed to making sure that the opportunities within our firm are equally accessible for everyone – regardless of background or gender.” Dave Dunckley, CEO
There’s more to life than work
Families, children, sports, night classes…the things you do and the people you’re with outside work matter. They can inspire, motivate and energise you. Inside the office and out. So, if you’d like to work flexibly, let us know. We’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.

Chief Data Scientist,-1,"About Us

Insurance is the single biggest industry in the world – there are more insurance policies than people. But seven in ten people say they think their insurer is actively trying to cheat them, and only 13% say they actually trust their insurer (and that’s according to the industry’s own representative body, the ABI). It consistently ranks as one of the least trusted, least recommendable industries on the planet. How can such a massive, ubiquitous thing be so fundamentally broken – and how can we help fix it?

We're Hiro, and we're building something we call smart insurance. We’re trying to make something that's exciting, intuitive, rewarding, maybe even fun - and there for you every day; not just if you need a pay-out. Insurance that’s personalised to you, and works with you to actively protect the things you care about instead of just sitting back and waiting for bad things to happen. It’s everything your old insurance isn’t, in other words.

We’re an ambitious, energetic startup and we’ve already built some things we think are pretty exciting. We’ve got investment in the bag and a carefully picked team of exceptionally driven, motivated people from strong backgrounds across the tech and finance spectrum. We’ve got offices in London and world-class talent remoting in from all over the world. Now all we need is you: a brilliant, insightful data scientist to help us join the dots and make them dance.

About You

You’re a seasoned chief data scientist with a proven background in developing machine-learning driven predictive models and optimisation algorithms (and successfully putting them into production). You’ll be working with insurance products, so a background in insurance, financial services or actuarial science in general is desirable. An interest in IoT could also come in handy. As well as developing our ability to model risk and price products, you’ll be helping us join the dots in areas like fraud detection, recommendation and personalisation – anywhere the data tells a story. Ideally you’ll understand how to visualise that complex analysis as creative assets so you can communicate it to other parts of the business.

You’ll be leading our data science department as we take Hiro from our first few beta testers to a national audience – so that means all the autonomy, all the creative freedom, and a lot of responsibility. You’ll likely have the opportunity to hand-pick and lead a team of other brilliant data scientists as we grow. If you’ve got intensity and discipline and the idea of owning and spearheading groundbreaking research gets you excited, you’re in the right place.

The successful candidate will have a strong mix of the below.
Strong track record applying data science or quantitative / statistical analysis in a commercial role. You understand how to translate business needs into your own research exercises, and vice versa, how to output findings we can use. Bonus points for a background in financial services.
Experience mining, accessing and analysing large datasets using languages / tools like Python, R, SQL, C/C++, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Rapid Miner… realistically, you’ll be telling us what tools you want to use. We’re not about micromanagement.
Experience implementing GLM, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Neural Networks… see above. It’s also important that you’ve used these in anger in real production environments. Bonus for AWS or other cloud deployments.
Ability to visualise your findings in ways that can be easily communicated across the business. Dashboards, creative assets, recommendation reports. You know how to make it understandable and actionable.
Masters or other advanced degree in Computer Science, Maths, Physics, Engineering, Statistics, or other technical field.
Amazing rates and great opportunities for the right people. ~£70 - 100K package, depending on experience and location. Options for equity, share in profits / savings generated by your work. Bring your A-game.",4.4,"Hiro

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

About the Role
The central Customer Care management team is expanding rapidly and the Global Workforce Management & Planning team needs to mirror this growth in order to provide outstanding support to our Customer Care teams. We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.

You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.

Requirements:

Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Chief Data Scientist,-1,"About Us

Insurance is the single biggest industry in the world – there are more insurance policies than people. But seven in ten people say they think their insurer is actively trying to cheat them, and only 13% say they actually trust their insurer (and that’s according to the industry’s own representative body, the ABI). It consistently ranks as one of the least trusted, least recommendable industries on the planet. How can such a massive, ubiquitous thing be so fundamentally broken – and how can we help fix it?

We're Hiro, and we're building something we call smart insurance. We’re trying to make something that's exciting, intuitive, rewarding, maybe even fun - and there for you every day; not just if you need a pay-out. Insurance that’s personalised to you, and works with you to actively protect the things you care about instead of just sitting back and waiting for bad things to happen. It’s everything your old insurance isn’t, in other words.

We’re an ambitious, energetic startup and we’ve already built some things we think are pretty exciting. We’ve got investment in the bag and a carefully picked team of exceptionally driven, motivated people from strong backgrounds across the tech and finance spectrum. We’ve got offices in London and world-class talent remoting in from all over the world. Now all we need is you: a brilliant, insightful data scientist to help us join the dots and make them dance.

About You

You’re a seasoned chief data scientist with a proven background in developing machine-learning driven predictive models and optimisation algorithms (and successfully putting them into production). You’ll be working with insurance products, so a background in insurance, financial services or actuarial science in general is desirable. An interest in IoT could also come in handy. As well as developing our ability to model risk and price products, you’ll be helping us join the dots in areas like fraud detection, recommendation and personalisation – anywhere the data tells a story. Ideally you’ll understand how to visualise that complex analysis as creative assets so you can communicate it to other parts of the business.

You’ll be leading our data science department as we take Hiro from our first few beta testers to a national audience – so that means all the autonomy, all the creative freedom, and a lot of responsibility. You’ll likely have the opportunity to hand-pick and lead a team of other brilliant data scientists as we grow. If you’ve got intensity and discipline and the idea of owning and spearheading groundbreaking research gets you excited, you’re in the right place.

The successful candidate will have a strong mix of the below.
Strong track record applying data science or quantitative / statistical analysis in a commercial role. You understand how to translate business needs into your own research exercises, and vice versa, how to output findings we can use. Bonus points for a background in financial services.
Experience mining, accessing and analysing large datasets using languages / tools like Python, R, SQL, C/C++, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Rapid Miner… realistically, you’ll be telling us what tools you want to use. We’re not about micromanagement.
Experience implementing GLM, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Neural Networks… see above. It’s also important that you’ve used these in anger in real production environments. Bonus for AWS or other cloud deployments.
Ability to visualise your findings in ways that can be easily communicated across the business. Dashboards, creative assets, recommendation reports. You know how to make it understandable and actionable.
Masters or other advanced degree in Computer Science, Maths, Physics, Engineering, Statistics, or other technical field.
Amazing rates and great opportunities for the right people. ~£70 - 100K package, depending on experience and location. Options for equity, share in profits / savings generated by your work. Bring your A-game.",4.4,"Hiro

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the role

In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants.

We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation, usually through our world class experimentation platform.

We are looking for a senior data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish

You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines in industry.
Significant experience with end to end productionisation of these models
Ability to take a fuzzy business objective and turn it into a problem that can be solved via machine learning and optimisation, in particular experience in selecting business-appropriate objective functions
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
Experience creating new decision making machines from scratch, and designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

About the Role
The central Customer Care management team is expanding rapidly and the Global Workforce Management & Planning team needs to mirror this growth in order to provide outstanding support to our Customer Care teams. We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.

You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.

Requirements:

Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff

It's a bonus if you have:

Experience using a Workforce Management system in an administrative role within a customer care environment
Experience deploying models to production and experiment monitoring
Experience mentoring junior colleagues

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

The initial solution has been built and you'll be able to lean on an external consultant initially, so it's not a completely blank canvas, but there is still lots to do.

Your new company is trying to solve an age old problem, but are coming at it from a slightly different angle, which is not only interesting from a business perspective, but also a data perspective.

They are also able to use this system in numerous different industries, making the potential for diversification very intriguing.

Established by an industry expert and backed by some impressive investors, they have big plans and as machine learning is such a key part to this, this role is critical.

Salary/Package:

The role is with an early stage start-up, so as you might expect, the benefits list isn't huge.

However, they are offering £60-85k salary, depending on experience - they're happy to chat to Senior Data Scientists, Lead Data Scientists, Principal Data Scientists or Heads of if they are keen to still be hands on, hence the range.

• Assessing and analysing data and/or information to produce clear and high quality qualitative and quantitative evidence which can be used to inform decision-making both within ONS and by external stakeholders.
• Collaborating with a range of stakeholders (internal and external) to research, develop and (where appropriate) implement improvements, providing technical and analytical expertise.
• Providing subject matter expertise within their area of work. For instance, by leading or contributing to how statistics guidance in the international manuals, guidance notes and similar should be interpreted.

About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",4.3,"Cuvva

We’re home to 5,000 phenomenal small creative businesses that we are proud to call our Partners. But, now more than ever, this community needs our support. So we’re doing all we can to shine a light on these dynamic entrepreneurs, waving the flag for small businesses and generally championing their socks off.

On top of our brilliant Partners, products and customers (not to mention our incredible team who have been busy beavering away from home since March), the last 12 months has seen great progress with our tech platform and customer experience. We are now looking to build on this momentum to drive our business to the next level. And that’s where you come in.

What we need

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team to help us and our Partners continue to grow by using machine learning to improve the user experience of our site and our marketing.

Reporting into the Head of Data, you and the other members of the Data Science team will collaborate with multidisciplinary groups variously composed of Software Engineers, Product Managers, UX Designers and Digital Marketeers to help develop solutions to user experience challenges and marketing opportunities.

Some of the Things You’ll Be Doing
Finding relevant products for different customers is an important goal for us. You’ll help us solve this problem by making predictions about customers’ tastes based on historical purchase patterns
Last-click marketing attribution models don’t make sense for multi-device and multi-session user journeys so we need to do better. You’ll build advanced attribution models that identify our highest ROI marketing activity so we can target our spend more efficiently.
We need to be able to optimise our site scientifically. A/B testing is a good start, but we need you to push the envelope with more sophisticated and efficient approaches such as multi-armed bandits
We believe developing people’s skills is critical. As a senior data scientist, you’ll be responsible for managing and developing junior members of the Data Science team
The data science team has several stakeholders, and we need to ensure that new work is identified early and managed efficiently. You’ll collaborate with product and marketing teams to identify, design, and iteratively improve relevant workflows and processes.
In several functions across the business, we’re reliant on tools that include some sort of machine learning component. You’ll help non-technical stakeholders make the most of those tools by making informed recommendations. You’ll also help promote ML and educate people on how to spot problems that can be solved using it
What we need…
Several years of commercial experience, or postgraduate experience with at least one year of commercial experience, in which you have implemented both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques using large data sets
Expertise in one or more of the following areas: recommender systems, search, text mining, reinforcement learning, attribution models
At least two years experience with the typical Python machine learning stack (numpy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn etc.)
A sound understanding of the mathematical foundations of your methods (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability)
Excellent SQL skills
Experience presenting your work to, and gathering requirements from, non-technical stakeholders
…and some other key skills & experience you’ll ideally have
Experience working in marketplace ecommerce businesses
Implementation of cloud-based ML solutions
Mentoring junior team members or graduates
Using R
Applying deep learning techniques
Statistical/probabilistic knowledge of hypothesis (A/B) testing
Writing good quality code which is designed to be reusable, testable and automatically deployable
Agile/Lean working practices
Our perks

It’s important to us that our people are well looked after, which is why we offer everyone BUPA healthcare, life insurance and a pension plan. Because having a break is important for your physical and mental wellbeing, our holiday allowance is 25 days (plus bank holidays) AND your entitlement increases an extra day for every 2 years you spend with us.

The team spirit at NOTHS House is legendary, and while we all miss the in-office massages, hair cuts and the abundance of free fruit, we’ve taken to our virtual world with gusto and bring the team together regularly for socials and of course the odd Zoom quiz!

We endeavour to support our people to make sure work….well, works for them. And the pretty big issue of the recent global pandemic has propelled us into working more flexibly than ever before. With the office closed until further notice (at least until government social distancing advice has changed), we’re using the lessons learnt over this period to evolve our approach to flexible working whilst ensuring we all still get together as one #teamnoths

Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to equal opportunities and to building a more diverse and inclusive team and are working with our recently formed internal community in driving progress.

About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",4.3,"Cuvva

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Science - Machine Learning Research based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Science - Deep Learning Research based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:

Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

Research Scientist – Evidence Synthesis,-1,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research
There are two Research Scientist openings. We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office; however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.
The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:
Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target
Direct other ""non-billable"" activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).
Serve as consultant to other principal investigators or staff on other systematic review projects.
Act as a guide and mentor to the staff across Evidera locations.
Travel (internationally), as is expected.
Skills and Experience
Demonstrated experience in systematic review (SLR) methods in health economics and/or health services research.
Deep understanding of research principles, relevant methodology and practical research implementation.
Specialist skills in network meta-analysis or epidemiology would be desirable, but are not essential.
Experience with HTA/regulatory submissions, including National Institute for Health and Care. Excellence, SMC, and other European HTA bodies and the European Medicines Agency
Excellent communication skills, including presentations.
Competent in written and spoken English.
Experience in using MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel.

Biomedical Scientist Band 5 Cellular Pathology,-1,"Western Sussex Hospitals is a leading acute hospital trust, with rewarding career opportunities for caring, committed and innovative people, who wish to be valued for their work and empowered to improve the services we provide. Here are few reasons to join us:

Outstanding – we are the first acute hospital trust to have received the health watchdog’s highest rating in all key inspection areas. CQC October 2019

Top 10 – Western Sussex Hospitals is one the best hospital trusts to work for, according to the NHS Staff Survey, and among the top ten trusts in England where staff are most likely to recommend the care their colleagues provide. (NHS Staff Survey 2018)

Leading organisation – Western Sussex Hospitals is led by NHS Chief Executive of the Year Dame Marianne Griffiths (HSJ Awards 2016 | No.1 HSJ Top CEO 2018 & 2019) and is renowned for outstanding care, excellent staff engagement, innovation and learning.

Location – our hospitals in Chichester, Worthing and Shoreham-by-Sea are on the beautiful Sussex coast, between the beach and South Downs National Park. West Sussex has wonderful countryside, picturesque villages, vibrant towns, excellent schools and cultural amenities, as well as quick transport links to Brighton, London and beyond.

More about us - Western Sussex is an acute trust with three hospitals; Worthing Hospital and St Richard’s in Chichester provide emergency, inpatient and outpatient care; and Southlands in Shoreham-by-Sea provides outpatient care and day surgery. Since April 2017, the senior leadership team has also managed neighbouring trust Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals.

Patient First - in 2015 the trust’s Patient First programme was launched to empower colleagues to make lasting changes that benefit patients and to ensure we continue to improve patient care with lean management best practice at every level of the trust. Improvement huddles are just one example of extensive and ongoing cultural change that makes Western Sussex an exciting place to work.

Cellular Pathology Band 5 HCPC Registered Biomedical Scientist – permanent full-time x2

The Cellular Pathology Department at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust currently deals with approximately 35,000 – 40,000 Histology specimens each year from across the county including St Richards Hospital, Chichester, Worthing Hospital and Southlands Hospital, Shoreham.

The bulk of the work is undertaken in Chichester and the successful candidates would be working within the main Histopathology Laboratory, which includes Immunocytochemistry, Special Stains, IF Skins, OSNA and Non-Gynae Cytology. We are continually updating our ICC (Leica Bonds) repertoire and hoping to further expand our Non-Gynae Cytology service. (Mortuary Services are also included within Cellular Pathology, but are not included within this role.)

This is an exciting time to join our growing department, which has undergone a considerable equipment refresh over the last 5 years, including the introduction of the Cerebro tracking system, new Peloris tissue processors and a new HistoCore Spectra stainer/coverslipper - with more items in the pipeline. We are currently awaiting confirmation of UKAS ISO15189 Accreditation.

The successful candidates will be working alongside other BMS's, AP’s (Band 4’s), MLA’s and Administrative staff - all reporting to the Cellular Pathology Head Biomedical Scientist. Whilst the work will be undertaken mainly at St Richards Hospital, Chichester, there will also be a requirement to work occasionally at Worthing Hospital too, as per the departmental rota system. The main area of work for this individual will be within routine Histology (including ICC & Special Stains), however it would also be advantageous for at least a basic working knowledge of Non-Gynae Cytology sample preparation and the OSNA procedure, along with the ability to cut Frozen Sections and some experience of Immunofluoresence techniques. Any experience of using the Cerebro tracking system, WinPath LIMS, Q-Pulse and SHE software will also be viewed favourably.

Ideally we are looking for those already HCPC registered but might consider individuals within 3 months of gaining their HCPC registration. It is important to be aware that the remuneration will be no higher than Band 3 until HCPC registration is attained – only once fully registered will the pay be increased to Band 5 level.

We will only consider applicants with at least 3 months of proven experience in a UK NHS Cellular Pathology department and proven competency in routine Histology, including embedding, standard & mega block sectioning and special stains.

Ongoing training is highly encouraged within this department and the successful candidate will be expected to commence the IBMS Specialist Portfolio within 6 months of their employment start date.

The roles are both for 37.5 hours per week working Monday to Friday. The laboratory official opening hours are 8am to 6pm on the Chichester site with an additional voluntary extra-early shift starting at 7am, and then 8am to 5pm on the Worthing site. There are currently a variety of formats available to fulfill these hours, e.g. working a standard 7.5 hours-a-day for 5 days or 8.33 hours-a-day on a 9 day fortnight rota, however the successful candidates will be expected to work alternate shifts along with the rest of the team, that is one week starting by 8am and the next finishing late i.e. 6pm.

Please note: there is an ongoing merger with Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, but it is not expected to affect this position for the foreseeable future.

About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:

Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the Role

We are looking for a senior data science manager to join our management team. We are looking for someone who:
Has experience managing data science managers as well as individual contributors.
Has experience being a data scientist at a mid/senior level, but is now not looking to do individual contributor work.
Has experience working with C-level stakeholders, as well as other stakeholders business wide.

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:

Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:

Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

Data Science at Deliveroo

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the Role

We are looking for a senior data science manager to join our management team. We are looking for someone who:
Has experience managing data science managers as well as individual contributors.
Has experience being a data scientist at a mid/senior level, but is now not looking to do individual contributor work.
Has experience working with C-level stakeholders, as well as other stakeholders business wide.
Is able to set company level strategy.
Is able to bring together a group of individuals from many different backgrounds and skill sets to form a cohesive team.
Is comfortable managing multiple teams in different business areas, and ruthlessly prioritising.
Is comfortable working in an extremely fast, constantly changing environment, with incredibly high standards.
Has a pragmatic, flexible approach, and most cares about achieving impact.
Life at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:

Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

Data Science at Deliveroo

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the Role

We are looking for a senior data science manager to join our management team. We are looking for someone who:
Has experience managing data science managers as well as individual contributors.
Has experience being a data scientist at a mid/senior level, but is now not looking to do individual contributor work.
Has experience working with C-level stakeholders, as well as other stakeholders business wide.
Is able to set company level strategy.
Is able to bring together a group of individuals from many different backgrounds and skill sets to form a cohesive team.
Is comfortable managing multiple teams in different business areas, and ruthlessly prioritising.
Is comfortable working in an extremely fast, constantly changing environment, with incredibly high standards.
Has a pragmatic, flexible approach, and most cares about achieving impact.
Life at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:

Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.
