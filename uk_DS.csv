Closing Date: 8th November 2020

STFC’s Accelerator Science and Technology Centre (ASTeC) undertakes particle accelerator research for current and future ‘Big Science’ facilities. We work on numerous high-profile projects with other STFC departments, national partners such as Diamond, and with international labs such as CERN, DESY and PSI. ASTeC has experience in designing, commissioning and operating particle accelerators, with a focal point for these efforts being a dedicated accelerator test facility – CLARA, hosted at Daresbury Laboratory. CLARA is being built in stages to test concepts particularly relevant for novel acceleration and Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) – providing a platform for underpinning R&D for a future UK X-ray FEL, while being broadly relevant for a variety of projects. ASTeC is a key partner within the world leading Cockcroft Institute (CI). We work closely together on a broad range of accelerator research topics and have a number of joint PhD studentships with CI university partners.

Accelerator facilities are major investments in research infrastructure, used to investigate many of society’s most pressing problems, so it is vital that they be utilised as effectively as possible. A key ambition for the next generation of facilities is to harness the vast amounts of data available in order to deliver rapid optimisation and control. Obtaining the ultimate accelerator performance will require a research and development programme incorporating online and offline data with advanced control methods such as non-linear optimisation algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Many of these techniques are still in their infancy and so we are planning to expand in this area. Therefore, many opportunities exist for a well-motivated candidate to work with the team of scientists, engineers and academic collaborators in developing new computational and data science systems whilst also helping to build the next generation of world-class ‘Big Science’ particle accelerators.

The role is to be ASTeC’s machine learning specialist, working to develop and implement machine learning techniques for particle accelerators. We are therefore looking for a person with machine learning training/experience who is excited by the challenge of applying their expertise in this area. We welcome applicants at both first degree level and PhD level, with recruitment to either Band C/D respectively. The ideal candidate shares our passion for applying programming and problem solving to science and technology. The role will sit within the Magnetics and Radiations Sources group, with strong connections to the Accelerator Physics group in particular but with broad connections with the various machine learning interests throughout the department. There will also be connections to the SciML expert group within the Scientific Computing Department and national and international networks, including specialist machine learning training opportunities. The successful candidate would in turn be expected to help disseminate best practices within ASTeC. The CI education and training programme targeted at post graduate level covers all aspects of particle accelerators.
Key duties will include the application of machine learning techniques to both online and offline systems. Machine learning techniques will be incorporated into advanced accelerator controls software to optimize performance during operation. Offline studies with datasets generated from the machine or simulations will underpin the online applications. Key techniques are anticipated to include data classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and image recognition.
You will have a strong background in a quantitative field (physics, maths, computer science, statistics, or similar) with good programming skills. You should have a solid understanding of the skills & techniques needed to work with modelling physics systems and experience with machine learning and data science techniques.

Data Scientist,-1,"Who are we?

Hi! �� We are Ravelin! We're a fraud detection company using advanced machine learning and network analysis technology to solve big problems. Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.

And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide. Join us and you’ll learn fast about cutting-edge tech and work with some of the brightest and nicest people around - check out our Glassdoor reviews.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.

The Team

You will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low – and clients happy – by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google’s Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.

Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it’s down to the Detection team to investigate why.

The Detection team is core to Ravelin’s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.

The Role

We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.

Evaluating fraud models is hard; often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You’ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you’re investigating the veracity of the model itself.

We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud: our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.

The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job – and understand why both are important.

Responsibilities
Build out our model evaluation and training infrastructure.
Develop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs
Write new features in our production infrastructure
Research new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour
Investigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models).
Requirements
Experience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn).
Strong analytical skills.
Being a strong collaborator with colleagues outside of your immediate team, for example with client support teams or engineering.
Being skilled at communicating complex technical ideas to a range of audiences.
The ability to prioritise and to manage your workload.
Being comfortable working remotely. While we are working towards getting everyone back in to the office, it is likely that the first several weeks of your time at Ravelin will be characterised by you or many of your colleagues working remotely. The ability to be effective in these circumstances will therefore be vital.
Nice to haves
Understand software engineering best practices (version control, unit tests, code reviews, CI/CD) and how they apply to machine learning engineering.
Tensorflow and deep learning experience
Experience with Kubernetes and ML production infrastructure.
Experience with Go, C++, Java or another systems language.
Benefits
Competitive salary & equity package
A minimum of 25 days annual leave + bank holidays
Flexible working hours
Individual learning and development allowance of £1,000/year
Remote volunteer opportunities and monthly company charity donations

Simply Business is well prepared to deal with unprecedented events. We’re an agile business by nature – and our hiring and interview process is no exception. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some parts of our hiring process may take a little longer than usual. Please bear with us, and rest assured that we're happy to hear from you and receive your application.

If it looks like you could be a good fit for the role, we’ll ask you to interview on Zoom – you’ll need WiFi and a laptop, or a 4G-enabled smartphone.

Technology. Award-winning customer service. Bleeding-edge data ability. Simply Business is a new type of insurance company, using all of the above to create the best possible insurance experience for small businesses and self-employed people. We love working here, and have even taken the number one spot in the Sunday Times Best Company To Work For 2015 and 16 lists; we’ve stopped entering now to focus on a few bigger projects, but you get the idea.

It’s a great place to work.

There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act. So no need to worry about school pick-ups, or a horrible commute.

Our people are our most important asset, so we focus on building a working life that helps us thrive, not stick. We're proud of our inclusive and supportive culture, and we're passionate about creating an environment where everyone's cultural backgrounds, skills, and perspectives are valued. Join us and you’ll be part of our journey to creating something even better, for our customers and ourselves.

We need a Data Scientist to join us in London.

The Data Science team’s mission is to transform Simply Business into a leading InsurTech AI-ready company.
Simply Business already uses data to successfully deliver value and drive company strategy.
Over the years, we’ve built an impressive data capability based on cutting edge technologies, including AWS cloud services, Snowflake and Kafka.

As a Data Scientist you’ll:
build, maintain and extend data science products to support different areas of the business
work with the rest of the Data Science team to assess ideas and opportunities
discover data insights and share findings with the rest of the business
engage with technology and business teams to explain and illustrate data science concepts
Responsibilities include:
proactively proposing opportunities and ideas to apply data science in the business
communicating complex technical concepts to both tech and non-tech people
keeping up to date with the latest trends in data science
What we’re looking for:
at least two years experience as data scientist
demonstrable hands on experience with statistical data analysis and feature extraction
demonstrable experience designing, building, testing and maintaining ML models to solve business problems
proficient programming skills using Python libraries for data science
proficiency with data visualization and business storytelling
proficiency with SQL and data wrangling
strong presentation and communication skills
experience working with non-technical stakeholders
What are the benefits?

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call ‘core benefits’. On top of that, you can pick and choose from the more exciting options we offer – whether it’s a full gym membership, lifestyle pot, comprehensive private health cover, extra holiday or a National Trust pass.

The ‘core’ stuff
These are available to all staff from your first day. Here’s the summary:

• a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day
• an automatic enrolment pension (employer-matched at 5%)
• generous holiday entitlement
• life assurance – 4 x your basic salary
• a health cash plan to reimburse your everyday medical expenses
• an extra day off if you get married or move house
• unlimited access to 24/7 virtual GP
• bupa nurse healthline
• employee assistance programme (EAP)
• eye care vouchers
• local discounts

The fun stuff
We also have a great deal more to pick and mix from, with things like:

• a full gym membership
• lifestyle pot (a pot of cash to be used against anything you want need: well being, personal development, hobbies or childcare costs)
• private medical insurance
• extra days annual leave (up to 5 days)
• shopping vouchers
• dental insurance
• travel insurance
• merlin pass
• taste card

But there’s so much more to Simply Business than insurance and memberships. We also commit to flexible working options, smart working (our offices are kitted out for you to work when and how you choose), cycle to work, eye test vouchers, and season ticket loan schemes, and we have a handy online form to put in any training or conference requests.

Best of all, though, are the groups, clubs, and adventures that come with the Simply Business territory. Forget a simple Give As You Earn scheme (although we’ve got that too) – we trek the Sahara for charity, take you on weekends away, throw epic summer parties, and meet up for book groups, public speaking coaching, yoga, manicures, beer brewing, and lots, lots more.

Our values

Everything we do comes down to these five values – empowerment, authenticity, simplicity, learning and pioneering. In practice, these will mean something unique to every person at Simply Business, but if you’re considering working here, give them some thought. They’re at the heart of our story.

Empowerment
We're trusted to get the right stuff done in the way that suits us best

Authenticity

"Data Scientist, Operations",-1,"We're looking for a curious, adaptable Data Scientist to join the Data & Customer Operations teams at Monzo!

You'll have the chance to analyse all aspects of our customer support operations and help the teams scale how we work to support millions of customers.

We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.

The Data & Customer Operations teams


The data team's mission is to

Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.

For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics. You'll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.

The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that's what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.

The role


The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.

A few examples of questions and challenges:
How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?
You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We're looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.

What's special about data at Monzo?


Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You should apply if:


What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!
You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues
You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions
You're comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You are happiest exploring data, making discoveries and understanding their implications
You can manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities

Your mission:

TransferWise has already pioneered new ways for people to transfer money across borders and currencies. Our customers can also manage their hard-earned money with the world's first platform to offer true multi-currency banking. Your mission is to help run the engine of the company delivering funds to wherever in the world our customers need them as fast as possible. Your team is also entrusted with managing risk from currency rate fluctuations allowing us to offer customers the real mid-market rate.

Here's how you'll be contributing to the Treasury Team
You will help automate treasury operational decisions, dig in piles of data to find golden insights and create production grade models that can be clearly monitored by our operations team.
You will help us manage liquidity and mitigate FX risk in the smartest way, build operational tools and develop strategies.
Your average day will include building new models, maintaining production models, evaluating new ideas, putting out fires etc... (there are no average days)
This role will give you the opportunity to:
Have a direct impact - You will get behind the scene of company transactions, understand where we need to send money and what is the best to do it so our customers get the fast and fair service they deserve. what you build will have an impact on millions of customers.
Work autonomously - we believe people are most empowered when they can act autonomously. So rather than telling you what to do, you'll work with your team to create a vision of your own. Of course, you can always gather feedback from smart, curious people across TransferWise but you'll have the freedom to make your own calls.
Be part of a diverse team - You will work in a team of Data scientists, product managers, engineers and operations across 4 Transferwise offices, a lot of video-calls and some travel is expected.
Be part of our mission to make money without borders the new normal
About you:
You are able to take ownership of a project and see it through from end to end, with past experience in doing so
You are data-driven with a structural and pedantic approach. You are be able to prioritise the value you can add, and manage your time effectively.
You see the bigger picture of business processes and can cut through vagueness to define precisely where and how a model would fit into our stack and what value it would add.
You have a Mathematics/Exact sciences/Engineering/finance background — for example, you're comfortable with deriving variance estimates and re-formulating quadratic optimization problems into forms supported by optimizers
You are familiar with a range of model types, and know when and why to use gradient boosting, neural networks, good old regression, or a blend of these
You have a good understanding of statistics, in particular Bayesian reasoning, and can estimate how accurate your results are, but also know when to stop analysing and deliver results
You are experienced in building machine learning models both on daily time series and on big data (100Ms of rows), using the right tools depending on the data volumes (our team uses Python, SQL, Druid and sometimes Kafka and Spark for shoveling data, but we're open to others ).
You have a solid knowledge of Python, and are able to make and justify design decisions in your Python code; you can throw together a REST service or a UI if need be
You understand fundamental technologies such as Kafka and Docker, and don't think twice about bringing up a new engine in docker-compose to have a play
You are comfortable with visualising and communicating data to various audiences, you easily articulate and present your ideas.
Some extra skills that would be great:
You are familiar with finance, trading or accounting terminology so that it's easier for you to understand, evaluate and explain implications of product decisions in Treasury.
We're people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you're passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you'll fit right in.

Also, qualifications aren't that important to us. If you've got great experience, and you're great at articulating your thinking, we'd like to hear from you.

And because we believe that diverse teams build better products, we'd especially love to hear from you if you're from an under-represented demographic.

A word from us


Everybody likes to say they’re different...

Newton was founded to buck the norm in management consultancy - to demand better for its clients. Because, for us, change doesn’t come from behind a laptop. It comes from getting under the skin of an organisation and learning first-hand how it ticks. It’s not about producing reports that gather dust on a boardroom’s top shelf; it’s about delivering results that actually work.We crack some of the biggest challenges that businesses and public sector organisations face.

We’re called upon to bring much-needed change, from redesigning social care to improving build efficiencies on aircraft carriers. The work’s varied and complex - just how we like it. And no one else does it quite like we do. Take our business model. We guarantee our fees against delivering results, and will only leave once our clients see those results stick. Bold - yes. Disruptive? Always.

Blindingly fast career progression means that if you show you’re ready to step up - you’ll be promoted. Because we recognise talent, not tenure. And with all the support, training, and development you need, there’s really no stopping you. No matter the role you join in, you’ll be surrounded by spirited, naturally curious people. People who want to learn from you, and who’ll also teach you a thing or two along the way. It’s how everyone goes further, faster.

CLARA is being built in stages to test concepts particularly relevant for novel acceleration and Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) – providing a platform for underpinning R&D for a future UK X-ray FEL, while being broadly relevant for a variety of projects. ASTeC is a key partner within the world leading Cockcroft Institute (CI). We work closely together on a broad range of accelerator research topics and have a number of joint PhD studentships with CI university partners.

Accelerator facilities are major investments in research infrastructure, used to investigate many of society’s most pressing problems, so it is vital that they be utilised as effectively as possible. A key ambition for the next generation of facilities is to harness the vast amounts of data available in order to deliver rapid optimisation and control. Obtaining the ultimate accelerator performance will require a research and development programme incorporating online and offline data with advanced control methods such as non-linear optimisation algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Many of these techniques are still in their infancy and so we are planning to expand in this area. Therefore, many opportunities exist for a well-motivated candidate to work with the team of scientists, engineers and academic collaborators in developing new computational and data science systems whilst also helping to build the next generation of world-class ‘Big Science’ particle accelerators.

The role is to be ASTeC’s machine learning specialist, working to develop and implement machine learning techniques for particle accelerators. We are therefore looking for a person with machine learning training/experience who is excited by the challenge of applying their expertise in this area. We welcome applicants at both first degree level and PhD level, with recruitment to either Band C/D respectively. The ideal candidate shares our passion for applying programming and problem solving to science and technology. The role will sit within the Magnetics and Radiations Sources group, with strong connections to the Accelerator Physics group in particular but with broad connections with the various machine learning interests throughout the department. There will also be connections to the SciML expert group within the Scientific Computing Department and national and international networks, including specialist machine learning training opportunities. The successful candidate would in turn be expected to help disseminate best practices within ASTeC. The CI education and training programme targeted at post graduate level covers all aspects of particle accelerators.
Key duties will include the application of machine learning techniques to both online and offline systems. Machine learning techniques will be incorporated into advanced accelerator controls software to optimize performance during operation. Offline studies with datasets generated from the machine or simulations will underpin the online applications. Key techniques are anticipated to include data classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and image recognition.
You will have a strong background in a quantitative field (physics, maths, computer science, statistics, or similar) with good programming skills. You should have a solid understanding of the skills & techniques needed to work with modelling physics systems and experience with machine learning and data science techniques.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Engineering and Product based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Headquarters: London, UK
https://profinda.com

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

What we are looking for

We're looking for a Data Scientist with 5 or more years of demonstrable experience to work with our Intelligence team on building a semantic, local-grammar based system.

This is a full time role and we would expect the successful candidate to spend at least two days a week in the London Office with the option to work from home on the other days.

As part of your role you will be able to architect and solve complex problems with the best tools you can find. You will research and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms, along with existing libraries usage and will be responsible for new ways of data usage discovery. You will also assist in product development, looking at things from a data perspective and be responsible for key textual data problems, suggestions and deep search.

Skills & Requirements:

· An experience with advanced application architectures (5+ years)

· Experience working with UniTex

· Keen interest in cutting-edge ML/NLP solutions and technologies

· Experience with Ruby, Python or Java will help but we can help you learn these if your experience in another language is good

· Experience with AWS services

· Knowledge of search systems (like Elasticsearch)

· The ability to quickly mockup a solution using one of common ML/NLP libraries (like OpenNLP, Gensim, NLTK and so on)

· An ability to draft a service for subsequent usage by other team members

· Strong Database knowledge (relational, non-relational and graph)

· Familiarity with using REST APIs

· Good writing skills, with a passion for documenting

This is a UK remote position

Who we are

The current system of credit, based on bureau data, is deeply unfair, penalising people who live in lower income areas, people who are new to the country or customers who have used high risk products in the past (such as payday loans). Koyo was founded in 2018, on the principle that everyone should have access to affordable credit regardless of where they are from, where they live, or types of credit that have used.

Many seeking credit are charged excessive fees and interest rates for borrowing that cause financial problems, rather than solve them. We’re changing all that.

Koyo uses innovative technology to offer fairly priced credit to millions of UK customers. We’re based in London, with global ambitions. Koyo is backed by leading venture capital funds (the same funds that backed the likes of Revolut, Transferwise and others) and some of the most reputable angel investors in the UK. Join us, and help put an end to predatory financial firms and be part of an exciting and rewarding journey.

Our story so far

In 2016, Thomas, the founder of Koyo moved to the UK and found accessing credit to be difficult if not impossible. This is because his credit history did not follow him from his home country. He realised that having an imperfect credit history affects millions of people who are new to the country, but also people who have failed to build a credit history in the UK more generally. In September 2018 we raised our first round of venture funding and have since raised further debt and equity funding from venture capital funds and private investors.

What you'll be doing

You will be our first dedicated data scientist hire.
Improve the accuracy of our in-house banking transaction classification engine - researching, evaluating and recommending the best machine learning algorithms.
Analyse the banking transaction data providing insights and recommendations for summary statistics and quality measures.
Analyse and make recommendations for policies that maximise loan approval rates whilst keeping loan defaults within target using and cross-referencing across all data-sets that are available to us (including but not limited to self-stated application data, credit reference agency block-summary and detailed data and bank transaction data).
Working across the wider team, providing proactive and reactive reporting and analysis.
Longer term, you will help build out the data scientist function at Koyo.

Research Scientist Evidence Synthesis,-1,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research
*There are two Research Scientist openings. We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office; however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.
The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:

Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target
Direct other ""non-billable"" activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).
Serve as consultant to other principal investigators or staff on other systematic review projects.
Act as a guide and mentor to the staff across Evidera locations.
Travel (internationally), as is expected.
Skills and Experience
Demonstrated experience in systematic review (SLR) methods in health economics and/or health services research.
Deep understanding of research principles, relevant methodology and practical research implementation.
Specialist skills in network meta-analysis or epidemiology would be desirable, but are not essential.
Experience with HTA/regulatory submissions, including National Institute for Health and Care. Excellence, SMC, and other European HTA bodies and the European Medicines Agency
Excellent communication skills, including presentations.
Competent in written and spoken English.
Experience in using MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel.

Machine Learning Scientist,-1,"Brief Description

Salary: £25,198-£29,390 or £31,305-£37,028 (dependent on skills and experience and inclusive of annual role-based allowance)
Grade: Band C/D
Contract Type: Open-Ended
Hours: Full Time
Closing Date: 8th November 2020

STFC’s Accelerator Science and Technology Centre (ASTeC) undertakes particle accelerator research for current and future ‘Big Science’ facilities. We work on numerous high-profile projects with other STFC departments, national partners such as Diamond, and with international labs such as CERN, DESY and PSI. ASTeC has experience in designing, commissioning and operating particle accelerators, with a focal point for these efforts being a dedicated accelerator test facility – CLARA, hosted at Daresbury Laboratory. CLARA is being built in stages to test concepts particularly relevant for novel acceleration and Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) – providing a platform for underpinning R&D for a future UK X-ray FEL, while being broadly relevant for a variety of projects. ASTeC is a key partner within the world leading Cockcroft Institute (CI). We work closely together on a broad range of accelerator research topics and have a number of joint PhD studentships with CI university partners.

Accelerator facilities are major investments in research infrastructure, used to investigate many of society’s most pressing problems, so it is vital that they be utilised as effectively as possible. A key ambition for the next generation of facilities is to harness the vast amounts of data available in order to deliver rapid optimisation and control. Obtaining the ultimate accelerator performance will require a research and development programme incorporating online and offline data with advanced control methods such as non-linear optimisation algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Many of these techniques are still in their infancy and so we are planning to expand in this area. Therefore, many opportunities exist for a well-motivated candidate to work with the team of scientists, engineers and academic collaborators in developing new computational and data science systems whilst also helping to build the next generation of world-class ‘Big Science’ particle accelerators.

The role is to be ASTeC’s machine learning specialist, working to develop and implement machine learning techniques for particle accelerators. We are therefore looking for a person with machine learning training/experience who is excited by the challenge of applying their expertise in this area. We welcome applicants at both first degree level and PhD level, with recruitment to either Band C/D respectively. The ideal candidate shares our passion for applying programming and problem solving to science and technology. The role will sit within the Magnetics and Radiations Sources group, with strong connections to the Accelerator Physics group in particular but with broad connections with the various machine learning interests throughout the department. There will also be connections to the SciML expert group within the Scientific Computing Department and national and international networks, including specialist machine learning training opportunities. The successful candidate would in turn be expected to help disseminate best practices within ASTeC. The CI education and training programme targeted at post graduate level covers all aspects of particle accelerators.
Key duties will include the application of machine learning techniques to both online and offline systems. Machine learning techniques will be incorporated into advanced accelerator controls software to optimize performance during operation. Offline studies with datasets generated from the machine or simulations will underpin the online applications. Key techniques are anticipated to include data classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and image recognition.
You will have a strong background in a quantitative field (physics, maths, computer science, statistics, or similar) with good programming skills. You should have a solid understanding of the skills & techniques needed to work with modelling physics systems and experience with machine learning and data science techniques.

About the Role
At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

At Deliveroo we’re always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we’re working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.

Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we’re investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We’re looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.

Some of the problems we’re working to solve:

How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments?
How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage?
How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments?
How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects?
How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out?
How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?

Responsibilities:

Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation.
Leveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methods
Prototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstances
Prototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team

Qualifications:

PhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematics
Broad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methods
Familiarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset

Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Engineering and Product based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

What we are looking for

We're looking for a Data Scientist with 5 or more years of demonstrable experience to work with our Intelligence team on building a semantic, local-grammar based system.

This is a full time role and we would expect the successful candidate to spend at least two days a week in the London Office with the option to work from home on the other days.

As part of your role you will be able to architect and solve complex problems with the best tools you can find. You will research and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms, along with existing libraries usage and will be responsible for new ways of data usage discovery. You will also assist in product development, looking at things from a data perspective and be responsible for key textual data problems, suggestions and deep search.

Skills & Requirements:

· An experience with advanced application architectures (5+ years)

· Experience working with UniTex

· Keen interest in cutting-edge ML/NLP solutions and technologies

· Experience with Ruby, Python or Java will help but we can help you learn these if your experience in another language is good

ProFinda
Headquarters: London, UK
https://profinda.com

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

What we are looking for

We're looking for a Data Scientist with 5 or more years of demonstrable experience to work with our Intelligence team on building a semantic, local-grammar based system.

This is a full time role and we would expect the successful candidate to spend at least two days a week in the London Office with the option to work from home on the other days.

As part of your role you will be able to architect and solve complex problems with the best tools you can find. You will research and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms, along with existing libraries usage and will be responsible for new ways of data usage discovery. You will also assist in product development, looking at things from a data perspective and be responsible for key textual data problems, suggestions and deep search.

Skills & Requirements:

· An experience with advanced application architectures (5+ years)

· Experience working with UniTex

· Keen interest in cutting-edge ML/NLP solutions and technologies

· Experience with Ruby, Python or Java will help but we can help you learn these if your experience in another language is good

· Experience with AWS services

· Knowledge of search systems (like Elasticsearch)

· The ability to quickly mockup a solution using one of common ML/NLP libraries (like OpenNLP, Gensim, NLTK and so on)

· An ability to draft a service for subsequent usage by other team members

· Strong Database knowledge (relational, non-relational and graph)

· Familiarity with using REST APIs

· Good writing skills, with a passion for documenting

· Excellent knowledge of English (spoken and written)

· Work in an agile team

· Understand the structure of existing applications and how to work with them

· Interact daily with members of your team and other teams within the broader Engineering team

· Review commits of other team members

Nice to haves:

· Knowledge of Docker and/or SpaCy

This is a UK remote position

Who we are

The current system of credit, based on bureau data, is deeply unfair, penalising people who live in lower income areas, people who are new to the country or customers who have used high risk products in the past (such as payday loans). Koyo was founded in 2018, on the principle that everyone should have access to affordable credit regardless of where they are from, where they live, or types of credit that have used.

Many seeking credit are charged excessive fees and interest rates for borrowing that cause financial problems, rather than solve them. We’re changing all that.

Koyo uses innovative technology to offer fairly priced credit to millions of UK customers. We’re based in London, with global ambitions. Koyo is backed by leading venture capital funds (the same funds that backed the likes of Revolut, Transferwise and others) and some of the most reputable angel investors in the UK. Join us, and help put an end to predatory financial firms and be part of an exciting and rewarding journey.

Our story so far

In 2016, Thomas, the founder of Koyo moved to the UK and found accessing credit to be difficult if not impossible. This is because his credit history did not follow him from his home country. He realised that having an imperfect credit history affects millions of people who are new to the country, but also people who have failed to build a credit history in the UK more generally. In September 2018 we raised our first round of venture funding and have since raised further debt and equity funding from venture capital funds and private investors.

What you'll be doing

You will be our first dedicated data scientist hire.
Improve the accuracy of our in-house banking transaction classification engine - researching, evaluating and recommending the best machine learning algorithms.
Analyse the banking transaction data providing insights and recommendations for summary statistics and quality measures.
Analyse and make recommendations for policies that maximise loan approval rates whilst keeping loan defaults within target using and cross-referencing across all data-sets that are available to us (including but not limited to self-stated application data, credit reference agency block-summary and detailed data and bank transaction data).
Working across the wider team, providing proactive and reactive reporting and analysis.
Longer term, you will help build out the data scientist function at Koyo.

Research Scientist Evidence Synthesis,-1,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research
*There are two Research Scientist openings. We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office; however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.
The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:

Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target
Direct other ""non-billable"" activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).
Serve as consultant to other principal investigators or staff on other systematic review projects.
Act as a guide and mentor to the staff across Evidera locations.
Travel (internationally), as is expected.
Skills and Experience
Demonstrated experience in systematic review (SLR) methods in health economics and/or health services research.
Deep understanding of research principles, relevant methodology and practical research implementation.
Specialist skills in network meta-analysis or epidemiology would be desirable, but are not essential.
Experience with HTA/regulatory submissions, including National Institute for Health and Care. Excellence, SMC, and other European HTA bodies and the European Medicines Agency
Excellent communication skills, including presentations.
Competent in written and spoken English.
Experience in using MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel.
Company Summary
Evidera is a global research consulting group that partners with life sciences organizations worldwide to develop, capture, and communicate the clinical and economic evidence required to substantiate the value of their products and optimize their products’ market access and commercial success.

About the Role

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is business impact. You will help answer questions like:

Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How should we improve our consumer, rider, and restaurant apps?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor’s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the food delivery market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How should we make investment decisions company-wide?
How should we decide which rider to assign to a given order?
Which restaurants should we show a given customer?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Qualifications:

Always curious and willing to learn new skills
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist – Causality Expert based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Data Scientist,-1,"An overview of the role

Do you want to help utilities companies identify pipeline defects before they burst using image analytics? Do you want to help retailers and consumer brands predict the next trends using Natural Language processing on social and search data? Do you want to help the government to try and predict and mitigate the impact of Covid19? Do you want to help aeronautical manufacturers to monitor performance of engines remotely?

What ever your sector or AI application of interest we at Capgemini Insights & Data UK (I&D) are currently working across dozens of clients on some of the most interesting and life transforming AI & Analytics projects. Helping our clients move further than just testing their ideas and concepts and looking to fully exploit their data using the power of AI & Analytics to deliver real business value at scale across the organisation. We don’t really have a typical day or a typical project which means we are kept on our toes and constantly learning. We work on small advisory or proof of value engagements all the way up to very large industrialised solutions across an array of public and private sector clients.

The work

If we believed all the stories about AI, then we’d be looking for budding magicians, wizards and sorcerers; but we don’t. So, whilst the reality is still, quite frankly, fascinating, it is achieved through a lot of ‘smarts’, rather than magic fairy dust. We want passionate, energetic people who live and breathe all things AI, whether that be machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and so on, combined with great software engineering skills…no point creating great models if we can’t deploy them! We want you to be thinking “how can I use what I know?”, “what do I need to learn?”, “how can I build the best relationships with my clients” in order to help achieve their business goals.

Why you?

We are looking to bring in people at all levels. The ideal candidate would have the skills necessary to thrive in a dynamic and fast paced environment but would also want to further both their technical skills and non-technical skills.

Priority skills:

We are looking for enthusiastic candidates with a passion for data science.
We want people who have a track record of delivering value for their clients/ customers.
Experience using Python or R
Knowledge of SQL for accessing and processing data
Capabilities in a range of AI techniques (e.g. supervised and un-supervised machine learning techniques, deep learning, graph data analytics, statistical analysis, time series, geospatial, NLP, sentiment analysis, pattern detection, etc.)
Strong interpersonal and communication skills for both presenting work to clients and disseminating complex information in an easy to understand form on a day to day basis

Things that would really impress us:

Data Science Platforms – Experience using the latest Data Science platforms (e.g. Databricks, Dataiku, AzureML, SageMaker) and frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow, MXNet, scikit-learn)
Software engineering – Good Software engineering practices (unit testing, version control, code review)
Data engineering – Understanding of data manipulation/wrangling techniques
Visualisations – Delivering insights using visualisation tools or libraries (Javascrip, Python, Tableau)
Cloud platforms – Experience building and deploying solutions to Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) including Cloud provisioning tools (e.g. Terraform)
Consulting skills – Ability to translate business requirements into plausible technical solutions for articulation to other development staff.
AI Ethics – Have experience in tools and techniques to ensure the AI model output is fair and stands up to ethical standards
Industry experience – Have extensive experience applying data science to particular industries: healthcare, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, etc…

Why us?

Professional development. Accelerated career progression. An environment that encourages entrepreneurial spirit. It’s all on offer at Capgemini. And although collaboration is at the core of the way we work, we also recognise individual needs with a flexible benefits package you can tailor to suit you.

Why we’re different

At Capgemini, we help organisations across the world become more agile, more competitive and more successful. Smart, tailored, often ground-breaking technical solutions to complex problems are the norm. But so, too, is a culture that’s as collaborative as it is forward thinking. Working closely with each other, and with our clients, we get under the skin of businesses and to the heart of their goals. You will too.

“I am NOT a number, I am a free man!”

That’s great to hear. So why are you working for a company that treats you like part of the data?

You love data. We love data. And we love people just as much.

Does your current employer stand by that claim?

Why not bring your data skills to a forward-thinking, ambitious and innovative engineering company who appreciates the value you can bring and will reward you accordingly?

We are pioneers in our sector and we understand the importance of data for progress along with the importance of developing and nurturing our people.

Change is coming and we are looking for someone with the ability to see these changes through the analysis and understanding of data sets along with the ability to influence direction based on evidence and to articulate compelling reasons why.

Sounds like fun hey?

Your previous experience of implementing data management systems along with your thorough analytical skills and sizzling personality will be the key to your success in this role.

And then you can enjoy being treated like a human being rather than part of the data!

Our digital platform is beautifully designed, non-stigmatising and globally scalable – helping to create healthier, happier, more human organisations around the world.

Unmind is transforming mental health in the workplace. We have developed a category-leading digital platform, raised over £10m from top-tier investors, and signed over 80+ clients globally – including the likes of John Lewis, British Airways, and Just Eat... but we’re just getting started.

We believe that everyone has the right to a healthy mind – because we all have mental health, all of the time – and we’re striving to create a world where mental health is universally understood, nurtured, and celebrated.

Research is now a key business priority, and our team is committed to ethical, well-designed research, so we can make a valuable contribution to the evidence base and demonstrate genuine thought leadership.

The Role – Research Scientist

We have humongous plans – and need lots of help in achieving them – which is why we’re looking for an exceptional individual to join the Psychology team, to help bring Unmind to the forefront of scientific research.

As a Research Scientist, you'll be joining a newly-formed and fast-growing team of researchers and psychologists, whose mission is to further the science of digital mental health care through rigorous academic research.

You'll take ownership of individual studies on our research roadmap, seeing them through from planning to publication. These will focus on efficacy trials that aim to evaluate the impact of Unmind on mental health and workplace outcomes.

You'll also have the opportunity to work collaboratively with other teams across the business, such as product, data science, and user research, as well as our academic partners from leading institutions.

In this role, you’ll get to:
Drive: Drive forward our efficacy work, from planning through to publishing. You’ll prepare rigorous study protocols and ethics applications to a high standard, and you’ll take the lead on planning data collection and analysis.
Collaborate: Form and maintain strong relationships with key stakeholders across the business, including our Content, Product, Data Science and Engineering teams, and with our external academic partners.
Disseminate: A key part of this role will be publishing findings in high-impact academic journals, ensuring that the academic community sees value in our work. You’ll diligently prepare research papers for submission to leading academic journals.
Share: You’ll represent Unmind in a variety of settings - either in person or virtually - giving engaging and inspiring presentations at conferences and industry events. You’ll also have the opportunity to coordinate with our commercial teams to help communicate and disseminate our research findings to a wider lay audience.
Skills and Experience


We firmly believe that no-one is the finished article and that there should be learning in every role you do. So some of the role will be learning as you go, and we hope that’s exactly what you are looking for. However, some experience in the following is important for the role:
PhD in psychology, health outcomes, clinical research or related field (or a strong MSc with at least 1 year of postgraduate experience of leading research projects).
Strong track record of publishing in leading academic journals with at least one first-author paper.
Proficient with statistical techniques such as mixed effects models, ANOVAs, linear regression, missing data methods, model comparison, etc.
Programming skills in R or another programming language (e.g. Python, Matlab) with the ability and motivation to quickly acquire R.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills with the ability to present complex ideas to a non-technical/non-scientific audience.
Willingness to roll your sleeves up and see jobs through to completion, and you never take a “that’ll do” approach.
Capacity to plan, prioritise and deliver several projects at once, and an autonomous attitude (you do not require, or like, micro-management).
A genuine and great human. We have built a special team and want to keep it that way
Good understanding of common mental health problems, psychological interventions, and measurement of mental health outcomes.
Passion for mental health, tech-for-good, and generally improving people’s lives.
Comfortable working in an environment of rapid growth, constant change, and lots of unknowns.
The Opportunity

At Unmind, we believe in uniting behind uniqueness. We believe our differences are what unites us as humans, and we seek out diverse opinions, beliefs, and experiences because they collectively make us stronger. We are committed to building an inclusive workplace and encourage everyone to bring their whole selves to work.

You will be joining a strong, talented team of ~80 people who are deeply passionate about making a positive dent to the landscape of mental health worldwide. We have incredible investors, partners, clients, advocates, and ambitions... which is where you come in.

Our future success(es) will rely on the continuation of that momentum – of which our ability to find, attract, and retain exceptional people (whilst retaining our strong culture and values) will be paramount.

Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the role

In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants.

We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation, usually through our world class experimentation platform.

We are looking for a senior data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities
Requirements:
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied.
You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines in industry.
Significant experience with end to end productionisation of these models
Ability to take a fuzzy business objective and turn it into a problem that can be solved via machine learning and optimisation, in particular experience in selecting business-appropriate objective functions
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
Experience creating new decision making machines from scratch, and designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact

How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be.

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

About the Role
The central Customer Care management team is expanding rapidly and the Global Workforce Management & Planning team needs to mirror this growth in order to provide outstanding support to our Customer Care teams. We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.

You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.

Requirements:

Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff

It's a bonus if you have:

Experience using a Workforce Management system in an administrative role within a customer care environment
Experience deploying models to production and experiment monitoring
Experience mentoring junior colleagues

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.6,"Deliveroo

About the job
Summary
Are you looking for a new challenge?

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the UK’s largest producer of official statistics, covering a range of key economic, social and demographic topics. These include measuring changes in the value of the UK economy, estimating the size, geographic distribution and characteristics of the population, and providing indicators of price inflation, employment, earnings, crime and migration.

Analysis Microdata and Engagement Division is an innovative and collaborative team that produces analysis and research covering all sectors of the economy. Our main customers include teams across the Economic Statistics Group (ESG), but we work closely with colleagues across government and with academia to ensure our analysis and research outputs are relevant for policy and build on work happening outside ONS. Teams in this Division lead on the development of key linked data sources alongside developing new methods for exploiting that data and using it to deliver new insights or to feed into the development of core economic statistics. This is a key role in leading the changes we need to enable this research and support better access to an improved microdata estate. The Data Scientist role covers a range of expertise areas that support the use of new data sources, new processes and new technologies.
Job description
This multi-disciplinary role broadly supports the aim to transform the way in which economic research and statistics are produced; providing data science supported evidence and data engineering support to projects. At the outset of each project, staff in this role will work from an initial design or concept phase, to successful implementation of proof of concepts, through to delivery of key data sources that can be made accessible across government and wider as well as ‘one-off’ experimental sets of statistics. This involves data interrogation, the coding of functions that conduct statistical or data manipulation tasks, as well as the coding of data processing pipelines. In many cases it will involve linking data either across survey and administrative data and developing longitudinal data for use in research.

The team are developing better economic statistics using new tools and techniques. That primarily includes a new cloud computing platform (DAP), making use of the Spark libraries to process and analyse large datasets (Python and Spark are the main tools that are used in the team) and secondarily supporting smaller projects with local systems built upon Python or R libraries. With this, we can apply data science techniques to produce timelier, more granular and more insightful statistics.

A key aim for staff in this role is to think about how new technology and methods can be applied to the development of economic statistics in the future. Individuals will be able to have the time and space to develop their skills and conduct research, with the aim of getting experimental statistics or analysis out to stakeholders and the wider public sooner.

Responsibilities
• Work with Economic Statistics experts to understand what analysis and research needs to be produced.
• Conduct data analysis and visualization of the key datasets used to produce the required outputs
• Produce initial design documents and diagrams for data processing systems, considering the statistical or data processing methods that are needed for the task, as well as the design of the overall data model.
• Contribute to Python libraries of statistical or data processing functions, ensuring that any functions are well unit tested.
• Write Python code that will systemize the processing of data, based on initial design documents. This includes writing unit / integration tests and managing versions of code with Git.
• Report on the progress of prototype systems to customers, clearly articulating the impact of various data processing steps on the outputs.
• Maintain and review documentation for statistical and data processing functions, as well as data processing pipelines.
• Manage working relationships with stakeholders across Economic Statistics, keeping people up to date on progress and highlighting any risks with projects.
• Apply agile project management principles to managing projects and tasks on a day-to-day basis.

Person Specification

Essential Criteria:
• Applied maths, statistics, and scientific practices - Understands, teaches and supervises a wide range of practices, or may have deep expertise on a narrower range of specialisms. Able to apply emerging theory to practical situations.
• Data engineering and manipulation - Has significant experience building data pipelines at scale using a range of tools and technologies and can advise on data engineering best practices across industry. Can lead ad hoc data exploration practices in their business area by identifying and setting best practice and standards. Identifies opportunities for future innovation of data exploration practices.
• Data science innovation - Is a thought leader in their organisation. Identifies future areas of innovation and can show how it can be applied to their organisation and wider government.
• Developing data science capability - Promotes and monitors continuous professional development within their organisation. Develops knowledge of cutting-edge techniques and shares knowledge. Propagates data science capability across the organisation and through external links.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Reinforcement Learning based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Chief Data Scientist,-1,"About Us

Insurance is the single biggest industry in the world – there are more insurance policies than people. But seven in ten people say they think their insurer is actively trying to cheat them, and only 13% say they actually trust their insurer (and that’s according to the industry’s own representative body, the ABI). It consistently ranks as one of the least trusted, least recommendable industries on the planet. How can such a massive, ubiquitous thing be so fundamentally broken – and how can we help fix it?

We're Hiro, and we're building something we call smart insurance. We’re trying to make something that's exciting, intuitive, rewarding, maybe even fun - and there for you every day; not just if you need a pay-out. Insurance that’s personalised to you, and works with you to actively protect the things you care about instead of just sitting back and waiting for bad things to happen. It’s everything your old insurance isn’t, in other words.

We’re an ambitious, energetic startup and we’ve already built some things we think are pretty exciting. We’ve got investment in the bag and a carefully picked team of exceptionally driven, motivated people from strong backgrounds across the tech and finance spectrum. We’ve got offices in London and world-class talent remoting in from all over the world. Now all we need is you: a brilliant, insightful data scientist to help us join the dots and make them dance.

About You

You’re a seasoned chief data scientist with a proven background in developing machine-learning driven predictive models and optimisation algorithms (and successfully putting them into production). You’ll be working with insurance products, so a background in insurance, financial services or actuarial science in general is desirable. An interest in IoT could also come in handy. As well as developing our ability to model risk and price products, you’ll be helping us join the dots in areas like fraud detection, recommendation and personalisation – anywhere the data tells a story. Ideally you’ll understand how to visualise that complex analysis as creative assets so you can communicate it to other parts of the business.

You’ll be leading our data science department as we take Hiro from our first few beta testers to a national audience – so that means all the autonomy, all the creative freedom, and a lot of responsibility. You’ll likely have the opportunity to hand-pick and lead a team of other brilliant data scientists as we grow. If you’ve got intensity and discipline and the idea of owning and spearheading groundbreaking research gets you excited, you’re in the right place.

Since launching our business credit card and business loans in 2017 we have taken off like a rocket! We are one of the fastest growing companies in the UK (Sunday Times Fast Track 100 in 2017, 2018 and 2019), and we've continued to show stable profitability throughout Covid-19. We anticipate that both our profitability and growth will continue, and if anything accelerate - in part supported by having been certified under two of the government backed lending schemes (BBLS and CBILS).

This puts us in a strong position to help even more small businesses! Our passion for collaborating and helping small businesses thrive has only increased as a result of the current crisis. This means the work from here on out is only going to get even more interesting and we are looking for a diverse and talented team to join us on our journey moving forward.

You will make an impact on the bottom line of the business with an ability to implement your concepts and theories. You will establish the path to achieve the company mission and see your ideas become reality from start to finish.

Coaching and mentoring more junior staff on decision science tools and techniques
Using your advanced analytical skill to help drive Credit decision making and overall Risk strategy
Conduct retrospective analysis on different data sources to evaluate their potential to add value to our current decisioning process.
Supporting in the live system implementation and ongoing monitoring of any models you design
Cohesively working with business stakeholders (from C-level execs to front line staff) to ensure risk analysis can be implemented seamlessly without deterioration to customer experience or complex IT builds
Constantly refining our decisioning process to improve its efficiency through greater use of automation
What we are looking for
5+ years of using SAS, R or Python on a regular basis to build statistical predictive models
Experience of assessing and monitoring statistical predictive models
Use SQL and Excel/google sheets on a daily basis to extract and analyse data.
Deliver quantifiable improvements while effectively communicating complex solutions in a simple manner (deliver ideas within a ""1 pager"")
Willing to operate in a fast-moving environment, initiating and driving quick pilots
Data-driven mindset, able to supplement soft analysis (e.g. customer survey data) with hard data (e.g. A/B test outcomes) through business modelling and analytics
Customer-centric approach to growth while balancing the need to remain risk-averse and compliant in a fast-moving regulated environment
Able to work autonomously, strong judgement and proactivity within a small credit team
Experience of techniques for handling small sample sizes such as bootstrapping would be a plus
Experience of building IFRS9 models would be a plus
Experience of coaching/mentoring/developing more junior colleagues would be a plus
What you get in return

About the job
Summary
The Department for Education has operated design and build construction delivery frameworks for over 10 years with great success – the Capital Delivery Framework management team has been responsible for delivering this success. Currently, we manage a design and build construction delivery framework with over 30 contractors ranging from SMEs to multi-billion pound construction businesses – the Construction Framework.
