We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Engage the software provider to confirm the best ways to integrate with the product and to bulk insert large data sets going forward.
Engage with Architecture and the Data Engineering squad to specify an implementation pattern for target systems providing large data sets for ingestion into the product, including when hosting moves. Implement the agreed pattern to enable integration between the systems while ensuring lose coupling between target systems and the off the shelf product.
Progressively release these new integrations as-built, decommissioning old integrations.
Provide hyper-care to the business following implementation to ensure successful operationalisation of the changes.
Implement progressively to reduce risk and provide business value early.

Engage the software provider to confirm the best ways to integrate with the product and to bulk insert large data sets going forward.
Engage with Architecture and the Data Engineering squad to specify an implementation pattern for target systems providing large data sets for ingestion into the product, including when hosting moves. Implement the agreed pattern to enable integration between the systems while ensuring lose coupling between target systems and the off the shelf product.
Progressively release these new integrations as-built, decommissioning old integrations.
Provide hyper-care to the business following implementation to ensure successful operationalisation of the changes.
Implement progressively to reduce risk and provide business value early.

Are you an engineer with great ideas and want to test them? Engineering at ANZ is the place to be
Our Engineers work on problems that matter most to our customers. Is this you?
We’re changing our organisation to become more of a tech company
At ANZ our purpose is to shape a world where people and communities thrive and to achieve this, we need a talented Engineer to join our Enterprise Cloud Platform. The Cloud Platform area is responsible for building and running ANZ's secure cloud platforms based on Google Cloud and AWS, enabling the bank to make use of everything the cloud has to offer - Containers & Kubernetes, Serverless, Big Data & ML, and more. We are also responsible for tooling, methodology and automation to enable rapid cloud adoption, as well as implementing and championing SRE principles to ensure that the cloud delivers the expected performance, reliability and availability to support our business. And we do this with sound engineering discipline, delivering cloud-native security, controls, and governance that mean we have a platform we can trust.
What a typical day might look like
As an Engineer within the Cloud Platform Tech Area, you will be responsible for building and running the cloud platforms for one of Australia's largest financial institutions. Don't let that scare you though, we're doing things differently for the cloud.
You will apply SRE principles to ensure we monitor and measure what is important.
Automate our platforms and services for reliable operations at scale, including automation of our security and governance controls.
Also assist development teams to apply the same principles to achieve quality in their releases and will be a subject matter expert on running services well on the cloud, sharing this experience with engineers across the organisation.
What will likely be in your toolkit?
We are looking for engineers that already possess some or all of the following skills:
You have built and run Cloud technology at scale and have experience with either AWS, GCP or Azure

Ability to advise upon, design and implement cloud security, availability and reliability best practices
Proficient with Docker, Kubernetes/OpenShift
Experience implementing Infrastructure as code via eg Terraform/Cloud Formation, along with continuous integration/delivery tooling such as Bitbucket/GitHub, Google Cloud Build/Bamboo/Jenkins, Spinnaker, etc.
Knowledge of IP networking is advantageous
Experience working with operations and architecture groups developing scalable and supportable solutions
While few of our engineers have all the skills above, they do all code. The particular language and tools used are not as important as your development skills and learning aptitude.
We’re making ANZ a great place for engineers to grow. You’ll learn and innovate because underpinning everything we do is a Growth Mindset. We’ll challenge you to become an industry-leading engineer while supporting you in a friendly work environment.
We’re reinventing the way we do banking, and our community of collaborative, innovative thinkers who create human centred solutions are helping us get there.

We’ll also offer you the opportunity to develop your career, working in a diverse and inclusive workplace where the different backgrounds, perspectives and life experiences of our people are celebrated and create a great place to grow, thrive and belong.

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

Who are we?
Glad you asked! We are Eliiza. Data science. Engineered for scale.
We are a passionate team of data scientists and engineers who apply data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems. Our mission is to create a bright future for Australian businesses and society in a world increasingly influenced by intelligent technologies.
We've created a culture that values diversity where people can truly be themselves! We care a lot about growing the Australian AI community in a positive direction, and we're doing several things to try and achieve that:
We provide opportunities for underrepresented groups to work in AI through our associate and intern programmes
We organise and participate in a range of community events, reading groups and meetups
We produce the AI Australia podcast
We blog about topics we care about
We stream brown bag sessions to the broader community
We're also part of Mantel Group's 'house of brands' which means it's not just the Eliiza team you'll work with, learn from and see at social events - there's another 230 of us across DigIO, Kasna & CMD Solutions!
So you're ready for something new?
We're keen to know more about you! Our team is made up of a range of people, with different experience across a huge range of data driven skill sets.
We'd love to hear from you if you have experience with:
one (or more) core language(s), ideally Scala, Python or Java
one (or more) cloud platforms, AWS, GCP, Azure
ETL/ELT concepts and technologies e.g. Data partitioning, Hive, Spark
streaming data concepts and technologies, ideally Kafka (Kinesis, Beam or Pubsub will do)
We'd be over the moon if you:
Experience with distributed/columnar databases (e.g. Snowflake, Big query, Redshift).
Experience with any of a variety of databases e.g. RDMS, NoSql, Columar, Distributed, Time series, Graph.
Knowledge of job orchestration and scheduling. Any experience with Airflow, Luigi or Oozie.
Experience with containers and container orchestration (Docker, Docker Compose or Kubernetes).
However, we value a diversity of skill-sets, and don't necessarily require that you're skilled with all of the above. If you feel you don't fit all the experience/skills listed above we still encourage you to apply or get in touch.
What's on offer if you join us?
We make sure you're always one step ahead by investing your learning and development, every year. We build our own training where it doesn't exist yet.
We hire smart people and get out of their way. By focusing on our five principles and not getting caught up in red tape, we trust you to get the job done.
You'll get all the tools you need - a new iPhone or Google phone, a new Macbook Pro or Dell, and a lot of branded swag!
But hold on, you mentioned a house of brands?
We certainly did! Mantel Group is an Australian-owned, 'house of brands' company with four technology businesses (Eliiza being one of them!) across Melbourne and Sydney. We're building a group of companies with open borders so we can support you to take on new skills without leaving an awesome team - we understand you won't have one job for life!
We may only be just two years old but Mantel Group has already been recognised #9 in the 2020 Best Places to Work in Australia and #4 in the AFR's 2020 fastest growing new companies.
