We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

With the ever-increasing diversity of workflows that we run on the data, it has become essential to ensure that our data is not only efficiently stored (from a cost point of view), but that we can reliably and predictably recompute the data at very regular intervals.
Monitoring data usage and finding ways to store and access data in the most cost effective ways is therefore crucial. As different strategies are required based on data access patterns, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with the Garvan IT department and the individual research groups to translate their project requirements into rigorous data management policies and lifecycles.
The policies and best practices you’ll define will have impact across the various centres and research groups around the Garvan, including the newly established Centre for Population Genomics (CPG) and the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics (KCCG).

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

Monitoring data usage and finding ways to store and access data in the most cost effective ways is therefore crucial. As different strategies are required based on data access patterns, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with the Garvan IT department and the individual research groups to translate their project requirements into rigorous data management policies and lifecycles.

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

The Opportunity
You will administer, manage, and program the data management pipelines of various types of genomics data generated by research projects that heavily utilize next-generation sequencing and related technologies.
Currently, the Garvan Institute manages over 5 PB of genomic data and we expect this footprint to triple over the next 4 years, with a mix of storage backends located both on premises and in multiple cloud platforms. With the ever-increasing diversity of workflows that we run on the data, it has become essential to ensure that our data is not only efficiently stored (from a cost point of view), but that we can reliably and predictably recompute the data at very regular intervals.
Monitoring data usage and finding ways to store and access data in the most cost effective ways is therefore crucial. As different strategies are required based on data access patterns, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with the Garvan IT department and the individual research groups to translate their project requirements into rigorous data management policies and lifecycles.

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Genomic Data Management Engineer,-1,"The Garvan Institute of Medical Research brings together world-leading clinicians and basic and translational researchers to break down barriers between traditional scientific disciplines and find solutions to disease. Founded in 1963, Garvan’s mission is to harness all the information encoded in our genome to better diagnose, treat, predict and prevent disease.
Our scientists work across four intersecting research themes: medical genomics, epigenetics, and cellular genomics; diseases of immunity and inflammation; cancer; and diseases of ageing affecting bone, brain and metabolism. In addition, three major Centres: The Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, the Garvan-Weizmann Centre for Cellular Genomics, and the Centre for Population Genomics.
This position will Support Genomics data management for multiple centres and research groups across the Garvan.
The Opportunity
You will administer, manage, and program the data management pipelines of various types of genomics data generated by research projects that heavily utilize next-generation sequencing and related technologies.
Currently, the Garvan Institute manages over 5 PB of genomic data and we expect this footprint to triple over the next 4 years, with a mix of storage backends located both on premises and in multiple cloud platforms. With the ever-increasing diversity of workflows that we run on the data, it has become essential to ensure that our data is not only efficiently stored (from a cost point of view), but that we can reliably and predictably recompute the data at very regular intervals.
Monitoring data usage and finding ways to store and access data in the most cost effective ways is therefore crucial. As different strategies are required based on data access patterns, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with the Garvan IT department and the individual research groups to translate their project requirements into rigorous data management policies and lifecycles.
The policies and best practices you’ll define will have impact across the various centres and research groups around the Garvan, including the newly established Centre for Population Genomics (CPG) and the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics (KCCG). To know about these research centres click here.
This is a 1-year full-time position with high possibility to extend with flexibility to work remotely. We are open to consider compelling candidates working remotely from elsewhere in Australia as long as they have full work rights to work and stay in Australia.
Primary Responsibilities
Administer, manage and program the data management pipelines of various types of genomics data generated by research projects that heavily utilize next-generation sequencing and related technologies.
Monitor and report the Garvan’s genomic data footprint on the various storage platforms.
Define data management policies for different research projects based on access patterns and project requirements.

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

Data Engineer,-1,"Who We Are
We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Does this role sound perfect to you? Do you want to join a company with a Can Do attitude and values that align with yours? If so, we want to hear from you!

We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

Our employees love our benefits, which include an employee reward and recognition program, free fruit, gym membership & flu vaccinations, purchased leave, 12 weeks paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, employee “mates rates” for our loan products and so much more!

Genomic Data Management Engineer,-1,"The Garvan Institute of Medical Research brings together world-leading clinicians and basic and translational researchers to break down barriers between traditional scientific disciplines and find solutions to disease. Founded in 1963, Garvan’s mission is to harness all the information encoded in our genome to better diagnose, treat, predict and prevent disease.
Our scientists work across four intersecting research themes: medical genomics, epigenetics, and cellular genomics; diseases of immunity and inflammation; cancer; and diseases of ageing affecting bone, brain and metabolism. In addition, three major Centres: The Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, the Garvan-Weizmann Centre for Cellular Genomics, and the Centre for Population Genomics.
This position will Support Genomics data management for multiple centres and research groups across the Garvan.
The Opportunity
You will administer, manage, and program the data management pipelines of various types of genomics data generated by research projects that heavily utilize next-generation sequencing and related technologies.
Currently, the Garvan Institute manages over 5 PB of genomic data and we expect this footprint to triple over the next 4 years, with a mix of storage backends located both on premises and in multiple cloud platforms. With the ever-increasing diversity of workflows that we run on the data, it has become essential to ensure that our data is not only efficiently stored (from a cost point of view), but that we can reliably and predictably recompute the data at very regular intervals.
Monitoring data usage and finding ways to store and access data in the most cost effective ways is therefore crucial. As different strategies are required based on data access patterns, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with the Garvan IT department and the individual research groups to translate their project requirements into rigorous data management policies and lifecycles.
The policies and best practices you’ll define will have impact across the various centres and research groups around the Garvan, including the newly established Centre for Population Genomics (CPG) and the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics (KCCG).
