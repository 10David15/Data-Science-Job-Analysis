After three months here…

You jumped right in. After a period of acclimation with your new teammates, you started work on an existing data analytics project, helping the team complete key objectives on time.
You’ve had a role in several other projects building ETL processes and expanding data warehouse capabilities. This has allowed you to build connections across the Resource Data offices.
You’ve started working with the business users to understand what they’re after and how you can help.
You’ve identified datasets that look intriguing. You’re comfortable working directly with the client and have started discussing how they might use them for better insights.
Three months in and you’re a bona fide member of the Resource Data team. The client sees Resource Data as their data analytics experts.

At six months you’re developing opportunities.

You’ve started working with the client on a new initiative. You’re leading the research and developing a proof-of-concept to validate the idea and turn it into a full project.

You’ve led an internal discussion about common tools used in data analytics and the problem sets they are applied to. This has led to requests from other branches to support developing data analytics practice areas.

After one year, you’re building Resource Data and have a vision of a data analytics team.

You’ve identified several other clients in the local area in need of data analytics services. You have worked with the proposal team to develop technical estimates and present proposals. New clients are coming on board.
You’re able to market the breadth of services Resource Data can offer and are expanding our presence with clients outside of data analytics.
You’re working with the hiring team to identify colleges and programs that provide the right mix of technical and analytical education so you can help hire the best candidates for a growing practice.

This is just year one. Imagine what you can accomplish after that!

We expect you’ve got a few years’ experience in a business setting applying your statistical and machine learning background using tools like R and Python.

We are growing rapidly and need great people to support our analytical efforts in both Product and Marketing.

What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem. It’s also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.

Senior Data Analyst,-1,"Please do not apply through Glassdoor; the application form needs to be completed in order to be considered. TO APPLY, VISIT: https://grnh.se/eb8d01633us.

About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:
Take analyses from end to end: Understand the client’s problem, identify the right research question, plan the methodology, corral the data, code the analysis, interpret the results, craft the deliverable, and communicate the story
Apply a research mentality: Use all tools at our disposal (documentation, policy regulations, data investigations, etc.) to make sound analytic decisions
Help the team deliver its best work: Turn direction from clients/senior staff into tactical plans and work closely with data analysts to help them implement (conducting code reviews, teaching/reinforcing analytic strategies, etc.)
This role will be a good fit for people who naturally push towards progress and are undeterred when that requires a lot of effort or stepping into unfamiliar territory. Emendata is growing rapidly, and we are looking for people who are excited to march forward together.
Qualifications: If you do not meet all the criteria below but still think you would be a good fit for this role, please apply so we can see if we can find the right spot for you on the team. We value experience but also welcome aptitude and enthusiasm.
Education: Bachelor’s or master’s degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training
Programming: Experience with SAS is a must (comfortable with SAS macro language, advanced DATA step techniques such as hashes, and PROC SQL); experience with Python, Stata, R, or SQL is a plus
Technical Mentorship: Demonstrated experience with reviewing code and providing feedback
Data Management: Comfortable with the process of importing, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis in a reproducible way
Analysis: Exceptional problem-solving skills with a good understanding of statistical/social science research methods; 4+ years hands-on experience in an analytics role (e.g., economic consulting)
Working Style: Intellectually curious (keep pulling on threads until finding an answer), enterprising (eager to tackle the unknown and find a way to make things happen), and collaborative (work with others to explore, build, tear down, and build again)
To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together. Part way through the interview process, we incorporate a lightweight at-home exercise that serves as the basis for a technical interview. The exercise gives us an outlet to show you what kind of problems this role would tackle and offers you an opportunity to show us how you would approach the work.",-1,Emendata,"Burlingame, CA",-1,1 to 50 Employees,-1,Company - Private,-1,-1,Less than $1 million (USD),-1

We're looking for a Data Analyst to inform the future of Webflow with data, building deep understanding of how our customers most successfully create for the web with our product. You'll partner with stakeholders throughout the company to identify their business questions and perform analysis that enables data-informed decision making. You'll be a champion for data governance and literacy by helping to define the company's KPIs and providing visibility through interactive data visualizations/dashboards.

As an early member of our data team, you will also be working to improve our data warehouse, thoughtfully developing clean, reliable data pipelines for lasting impact.

As a Data Analyst you'll …
Enable team members across the organization by translating their business initiatives and goals into analytical questions.
Empower Webflow employees to access reliable, clean, business data by emphasizing quality and best practices, identifying and implementing improvements to our data pipeline such as better documentation, anomaly detection, alerting and instrumentation.
Partner with teams to make critical decisions with data using insightful visualizations, dashboards and reporting, growing data literacy at Webflow.
Develop our data foundation, building new pipelines and models that contribute to our connected, complete understanding of our customer journey. We currently use stitch, dbt, snowflake and Tableau!

thrive collaborating with business teams in a fast-paced and sometimes ambiguous environment
engage both technical and nontechnical stakeholders with clear and compelling communication
