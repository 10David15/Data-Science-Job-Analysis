We are a diversified, global financial services business with a unified goal to help our customers, our partners and more importantly our people to succeed. We set our customers up for success by offering our insight and extensive experience to provide balanced and real solutions across three key disciplines – Lending, Asset Servicing and Advisory. Our people matter to us. For them, we create opportunities for development in an agile, collaborative and innovative environment.

We live by our 3 Core Values:
Can Do - We are ambitious and entrepreneurial, so we look for opportunities. We think outside of the box when it comes to developing solutions for our customers and our teams. We leverage the power of teamwork to deliver.
Balanced - We come with considerable experience and know how to handle the relationship between opportunity and risk. We understand how to create situations that can set people up for success, and that even in adversity producing a win-win is both human and profitable.
Real - We tell it like it is. We respect people and keep it honest. If we can help, we will. If we can't we will say so. People want you to be straight with them and they like to understand how things are going – so we tell them. Trust is built by acting with integrity, by doing what you said you would. By understanding what people need.

The Technology department is an integral part of the Pepper team, providing a range of services and expertise in delivering robust infrastructure, analytics and digital solutions to a fast-paced environment.

The Role
We are seeking an experienced Data Engineer to join us on our journey of becoming the No.1 consumer finance house in each of our markets.
As the Data Engineer, you will facilitate the work of the data science team by improving the data framework through both database integration and advanced feature engineering.

The work will focus on two primary streams:
Assisting in integrating the data framework (mainly through APIs) by adding external data into our business development layer (BDL) which will collect our credit information and supplement it with a variety of alternative data such as cyclical macro-economic indicators, credit bureau information, house price and lending data so that the data science team can conduct advanced analysis to solve business problems in a variety of areas: credit scoring, probability of default modelling, risk-based loan pricing and churn prediction.
The second stream will be focused more in the data science world through feature engineering; using your statistical and business acumen to develop features for use in our data science algorithm.

This will require you to be an excellent critical thinker as the production of useful features is more of an art than a science.

Ideally, you will be an exceptional data engineer who has a desire or, has made elementary steps toward, becoming a data scientist. Once our data infrastructure is set up and robust, there will be more opportunity to participate in front-end delivery of data science projects.

What We Are Looking for in You
Education
Bachelor or above in any quantitative degree (physics, economics, statistics, maths, engineering etc.)
Candidates with exceptional and relevant experience and work history and no tertiary education will also be considered
Desirable: University courses covering object orientated programming, regression and classification would be desirable

Experience
SQL scripting, particularly for database integration
Alteryx software for data pre-processing of data and feature engineering as well as adding to the BDL
Development and maintenance of APIs
Desirable: Experience with Data Robot is advantageous
Desirable: Experience in a data processing software other than Alteryx (in lieu of Alteryx experience)
Desirable: Experience with Python (particularly the data science and API packages) is highly desirable
Desirable: Experience with web scraping is highly desirable
Desirable: Credit risk or macro-economic experience would be useful also

What We Will Provide You in Return
In return, we will offer you a values-based and diverse environment, a leadership team that challenges and inspires you to continue to strive for success, a learning framework to support your development and a culture that rewards and recognises strong performance and potential.

We certainly did! Mantel Group is an Australian-owned, 'house of brands' company with four technology businesses (Eliiza being one of them!) across Melbourne and Sydney.

We've created a culture that values diversity where people can truly be themselves! We care a lot about growing the Australian AI community in a positive direction, and we're doing several things to try and achieve that:
We provide opportunities for underrepresented groups to work in AI through our associate and intern programmes
We organise and participate in a range of community events, reading groups and meetups
We produce the AI Australia podcast
We blog about topics we care about
We stream brown bag sessions to the broader community
We're also part of Mantel Group's 'house of brands' which means it's not just the Eliiza team you'll work with, learn from and see at social events - there's another 230 of us across DigIO, Kasna & CMD Solutions!
So you're ready for something new?
We're keen to know more about you! Our team is made up of a range of people, with different experience across a huge range of data driven skill sets.
If you're the right Data Scientist for us, you'll have:
an undergraduate degree in maths or statistics, or a postgraduate in broader disciplines such as the sciences
commercial data science experience across different industries and organisations
an understanding of key statistical and machine learning concepts across different areas of data science
the ability to manipulate complex data sets to visualise and model the data
experience using at least one open source data science language such as Python or R
fundamental software engineering skills
an awareness of relevant data and ML engineering concepts (e.g. database management, processing pipelines, and model deployment)
consulting experience, either with external clients or internally within an organisation
the ability to plan and implement the different phases of a data science project
a genuine passion for and connection to the data science and ML community
However, we value a diverse of skill-sets, and don't necessarily require that you're skilled with all of the above. If you feel you don't fit all the experience/skills listed above we still encourage you to apply or get in touch.
What's on offer if you join us?
We make sure you're always one step ahead by investing your learning and development, every year. We build our own training where it doesn't exist yet.
We hire smart people and get out of their way. By focusing on our five principles and not getting caught up in red tape, we trust you to get the job done.
You'll get all the tools you need - a new iPhone or Google phone, a new Macbook Pro or Dell, and a lot of branded swag!
But hold on, you mentioned a house of brands?
We certainly did! Mantel Group is an Australian-owned, 'house of brands' company with four technology businesses (Eliiza being one of them!) across Melbourne and Sydney. We're building a group of companies with open borders so we can support you to take on new skills without leaving an awesome team - we understand you won't have one job for life!
We may only be just over 2 years old but Mantel Group has already been recognised #9 in the 2020 Best Places to Work in Australia and #4 in the AFR's 2020 fastest growing new companies.

We produce the AI Australia podcast
We blog about topics we care about
We stream brown bag sessions to the broader community
